The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them. There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn\'t give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status. It\'s possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that\'s dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it\'s the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red. Those in support aren\'t faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there\'s Roger Deakins\' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman\'s score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy\'s state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart. If you love Shawshank then it\'s a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 43), ('Thriller', 42), ('Crime', 34), ('Action', 29), ('Other', 111)]}, {'writer': 'elshaarawy', 'score': '90%', 'review': 'very good movie 9.5/10 محمد الشعراوى', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 1), ('Crime', 1), ('Other', None)]}, {'writer': 'tmdb73913433', 'score': '60%', 'review': 'Make way for the best film ever made people.Make way.', 'most_watched_genres': []}, {'writer': 'thommo_nz', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'There is a reason why this movie is at the top of any popular list your will find.\nVery strong performances from lead actors and a story line from the literary brilliance of Stephen King (and no, its not a horror).\nSufficient drama and depth to keep you interested and occupied without stupefying your brain.

Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Red deliver deeply moving performances, capturing the bond that grows between two men confined by walls but freed by hope. Every scene feels purposeful, and the script, adapted from Stephen King’s novella, is simply brilliant in how it weaves small moments into a powerful narrative. One of the most unforgettable parts of the movie is Brooks’ storyline. Watching him leave the world he knew, only to find himself unable to adapt to a society that had progressed beyond his comprehension, is heartbreaking every time. It’s a stark reminder of how institutionalization can strip people of their ability to live freely, even after they've served their time. That moment, along with Red’s own journey, adds a bittersweet layer of realism to the story’s broader themes of freedom and redemption. The direction by Frank Darabont is masterful, turning what could have been a straightforward prison drama into something deeply profound. The setting of Shawshank feels both oppressive and oddly serene, perfectly capturing the tone of the story. The simplicity of the plot is its strength, allowing the characters and their emotional arcs to take center stage.

From The American Film Institute to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the pinnacle crime drama.\nThe Godfather revolves around the Corleone’s, an Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the Corleone’s is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World War II, doesn’t want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo’s, a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange for profits from the Sollozzo’s drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into the mafia lifestyle.\nThe characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James Caan as Don’s oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances. All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It’s fascinating to watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in particular changing drastically.\nDirecter Francis Ford Coppola, being raised in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola’s first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian film 8 1/2. \nThis film should be immediately followed up by it’s sequel, The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They’re both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won’t be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings.

The characterisations are layered and colourful; Diane Keaton has no idea what she\'s getting herself into! John Cazale is great as the spineless brother ""Fredo"" too. Once again, Nino Rota pulls out all the stops to give this a score that helps cement this film\'s place as amongst the best ever made.

Based on Mario Puzo’s bestselling novel, the movie seamlessly blends crime drama with an epic exploration of power, loyalty, and family. Every frame is a testament to Coppola’s brilliance, as he transforms a gripping tale into a timeless work of art. At the center of this monumental film is Marlon Brando’s unforgettable performance as Vito Corleone. Brando masterfully embodies the aging patriarch with an aura of quiet menace and profound wisdom, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. Al Pacino delivers a career-defining performance as Michael Corleone, evolving from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader in a chilling, yet utterly believable transformation. James Caan as the fiery Sonny Corleone and Robert Duvall as the cool-headed consigliere Tom Hagen also shine, each adding complexity and depth to their roles. Coppola’s direction is nothing short of visionary. His ability to craft an intricate narrative while maintaining a deliberate pace allows the characters and themes to breathe. The cinematography by Gordon Willis, often referred to as the “Prince of Darkness,” enhances the film’s iconic look, using shadows and warm tones to convey a sense of both intimacy and foreboding. Nino Rota’s haunting score, particularly the famous Godfather Waltz, further elevates the film into legend. A fun fact: The studio initially resisted casting Marlon Brando, who was considered difficult to work with at the time. Coppola had to fight for him and famously convinced the studio by showing a test reel of Brando stuffing his cheeks with cotton balls to transform into the iconic Don Vito Corleone. The rest, as they say, is history. The Godfather isn’t just a movie—it’s an experience. It’s a study of power and morality, a family saga, and a crime thriller all rolled into one. Its influence on filmmaking is immeasurable, and its performances, direction, and storytelling remain unparalleled. This is a film that stands the test of time, and for good reason: it’s a masterpiece in every sense of the word.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Thriller', 63), ('Action', 44), ('Drama', 32), ('Horror', 32), ('Other', 102)]}]",100,Yes!

But this movie is special because as a Jew Spielberg felt the pain of Holocaust and thus this was personal. Spielberg’s paternal grandparents were Jews from Ukraine. I really hope things cool down very soon in Ukraine and somebody someday make a film on the crisis in Ukraine. After watching “The Kashmir Files” I felt like watching the list because I wanted to see how we can make better movies without the propaganda. The Kashmir Files is necessary minus the very few political flaws and propaganda it subtly injects into its viewers. Asking the questions is not anti-national and not all JNU people come with an agenda. Kashmir Files tells many truths and ought to be told but also hides a lot of the actual/factual truths. Just like a dictator it blatantly shows only the side they want to without any iota of balance. But Schindler’s List is different because it never lets the bleakness of the Holocaust overwhelm its important theme of fighting for the common good. The director says, “My primary purpose in making Schindler’s List was for education. The Holocaust had been treated as just a footnote in so many textbooks or not mentioned at all. Millions knew little if anything about it. Others tried to deny it happened at all.” Keneally’s best-known work, Schindler’s Ark was published in 1982; also known as Schindler’s List and film released in 1993, tells the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved more than 1,300 Jews from the Nazis. . Liam Neeson plays very well Schindler however shows his true side that he was a playboy and so on. He was not a saint. He cheated on his wife, drank excessively and spied for Abwehr, the counter-espionage arm of the Wehrmacht (German army), in Czechoslovakia. But the true characteristics of human beings cannot be spliced even in the most fascist regimes. Sometimes character flaws bring in real joy, excitement and belief. Steven Spielberg’s movie, Schindler’s List, while important, impressive and admirable in many respects, tries to show the true face of propaganda and mass bullshit and how an entire nation can be mass brainwashed to fuel hatred amoung it’s people and bring a great nation down. Something India and Indians need to really ponder upon. After Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Oskar Schindler sets up an enamelware factory in Krakow that used a combination of Jewish workers interred by the Germans and free Polish workers. His initial interest, of course, was to make money. But as time went on, he grew to care about his Jewish workers, particularly those with whom he came into contact on a daily basis. In addition, helping Jews became a way to fight against what he viewed as disastrous and brutal policies emanating from Adolf Hitler and the SS. Oskar Schindler convinced German authorities his factory was vital and that he needed trained workers. But Schindler did not author or dictate the list instead, Marcel Goldberg, a Jewish “clerk” compiled it. There is a line in the movie which goes like, “That’s not just good old fashioned Jew hate talk. Its policy now” and it hits hard and makes us aware that nothing has changed in present too. Itzhak Stern, played in the movie by Ben Kingsley was one of the most powerful character more of culmination of lot of people at that time. Oskar Schindler was a great man publicly and a not so great man privately but he saved the lives of more than 1,000 Jews during the Holocaust and that’s why a movie has been made on him. The imperfections in his character and the nuances in the historical record only make his story more remarkable. The movie’s budget was just $22 million. No one had ever made a profitable film about the Holocaust. Spielberg himself didn’t take a salary, calling it “blood money.” Something Vivek Agnihotri and makers of “The Kashmir Files” should ponder upon. As I write this Kashmir Files has already touched 250 Cr. Such sensitive films should come with not just spontanity but also empathy which is found in Spielberg and lacks in Agnihotri’s. This movie reminded me of another Spielberg movies which moved and caved in Bridge of Spies. Bridge was about the fine art of negotiation and the List is about the fine art of “Gratitude” you will hear this word a lot in the Schindler’s List. I felt both the movies very similar and fantastic. The use of black and white cinematography also makes me think of “KOTA FACTORY” both shot in black and white to resemble the dark and hollowness of the subject material. Art does make you uncomfortable and that’s it’s Dharma and Karma but propoganda does give you only the bigoted narration with giving the example that his master is always a good guy. In one scene, Schindler implores Goeth to spray water into the cars on a hot day to help the dehydrated Jews inside. Goeth tells him that to do so would give false hope—a clear implication that the trains deliver Jews to their deaths.The lists become increasingly ominous during sorting exercises to determine who is fit to work or who is “essential” and who is not. Those deemed “unessential” are placed on the list to be evacuated to extermination camps. Stern’s name appears on a list sending him to Auschwitz. When Schindler saves him, an SS officer mentions that it doesn’t matter which Jew gets on the train, and that keeping track of names just means more paperwork. This disregard for names and particularity symbolizes the extent to which the Nazis dehumanized Jews. Schindler’s list is one that saves lives. The Nazis’ lists represent evil and death, but Schindler’s list represents pure good and life. In an ironic twist, the final list in the film is a list that Schindler’s workers give to him—a list of their signatures vouching for Schindler as a good man, to help him if Allied soldiers catch him. The saved in turn become saviors. The one-armed man who thanks Schindler for employing him and making him “essential” is shot in the head by an SS officer as he shovels snow the next day. Blood flows from his head, staining the surrounding snow. In a later scene, Goeth orders the execution of a Jewish woman engineer who tells Goeth of a fatal construction error. Her blood, too, pours from her head and darkens the snow around her. The blood pouring from the victims’ heads is both literally and metaphorically the lifeblood being bled out of the Jewish race. In yet another scene, Goeth attempts to execute a rabbi working at the Plaszów labor camp. The rabbi stays kneeling as Goeth again and again attempts to shoot him in the head. But the gun jams, and the rabbi is spared, symbolizing the tenuous protection the Schindlerjuden had and the fine line between life and death. The film talks about the corruption of not just money but hearts and minds too. It shows us privileges and different aspects of life while keeping humanity before profits and ideologies. Intricacies of personal and professional lives are intertwined here for the good sake. The film ends with – “WHOEVER SAVES ONE LIFE, SAVES THE WORLD ENTIRE.” The actual Oskar Schindler died in 1974 and was buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion. He is the only former member of the Nazi Party to be honored in this way. He and his wife Emilie were named Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli government in 1993, something that would be hard to believe could happen without the film highlighting his life. As we all know, Spielberg and the film went on to win several Academy Awards for Schindler’s List, including Best Picture and Best Director. The film also won for Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing. Spielberg would win another Best Director Oscar for Saving Private Ryan five years later, but for him what happened with Schindler would be his crowning achievement. Schindler’s List is a rare movie whose legacy is just as important as its existence. Perhaps the lasting legacy of the film, aside from tolerance, is the image of the girl in red. During the liquidation of the ghetto scene, we see a little girl wandering. She serves as the person Schindler and the audience fixate on. The weight of the atrocity that we carry as viewers.When prompted to talk about one of the only color moments in the film, the girl in red, Spielberg told USA Today, “In (Thomas Keneally’s) book, Schindler couldn’t get over the fact that a little girl was walking during the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. While everyone was being put on trucks or shot in the street, one little girl in a red, red coat was being ignored by the SS.” For Spielberg, that came to symbolize the blind eye world leaders turned to the murders going on in Europe. “To me, that meant that Roosevelt and Eisenhower—and probably Stalin and Churchill—knew about the Holocaust… and did nothing to stop it. It was almost as though the Holocaust itself was wearing red.” Same repeats in Ukraine too. Spielberg helped develop and found The Shoah Foundation. It furthered the education and established “The Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation” to document the testimonies of thousands of survivors. For Spielberg, he wanted future generations to have these eyewitness accounts to serve as a permanent record. He hoped that there would never be a time we saw Nazism and fascism on the rise again. The project has collected the testimony of more than 55,000 survivors and witnesses to the Holocaust as well as other atrocities. “It wouldn’t have happened without Schindler’s List,” he said. “The Shoah Foundation wouldn’t exist.” Something the Hypocritic Vivek Agnihotri should think about. I still stand by that “The Kashmir files” should be shown to everyone without propoganda and only one agenda that this atrocities and “Genocide” should not be repeated on any one anywhere. The film is available on Netflix.

Well here, Steven Spielberg takes that dangerous occupation and scales it up somewhat as the eponymous Czech industrialist and arms manufacturer (Liam Neeson) finds his increasing revulsion to the brutality of their new occupying power driving him, with the able assistance of his Jewish factory manager ""Stern"" (Ben Kingsley), to find ways to keep them from being routinely slaughtered. Getting them out is not really an option, so he invents ways of convincing the authorities that they are more useful alive and decently fed/housed - even suggesting the usefulness of children\'s small fingers to polish shell casings - to avoid them being deported to the now fully functioning Auchwitz extermination camp. The story is history but the manner in which it is delivered here is poignant and potent. Schindler\'s gradual shift from a venally induced indifference to one of active concern is well handled by Neeson\'s considered performance and Kingsley works well as his low-level but crucial co-conspirator. Plaudits must also go to Ralph Fiennes with, I think, the best portrayal of his career as the odious Commandant Goeth who combines just about every element of the worst in human nature into one ghastly individual eliciting a palpable degree of loathing. Does it need to be 3¼ hours long? Well I\'m not so sure about that, and there are times when the repetitive oppressiveness of their gruelling environment risks de-sensitising the message a little, but for the most part the abusive and terrifying lives led by the Jewish prisoners and the increasingly perilous path being taken by those trying to help is well held together with some stunning cinematography and an untypical John Williams score.

This story gradually fills us in with the details of the crime, with the statements of the witnesses and, initially at any rate, illustrates just how cursorily many of these men treat this case. They want to get home for dinner, for a baseball game, to their wives and children. The fact that they are considering the life and death of an eighteen year old man seems tangential to the inconvenience they are facing or to the value they place on this man's survival. Reginald Rose's original screenplay takes us through the whole gamut of human bigotries and intolerances with everything from ageism, racism, respect and sexism rearing their ugly heads as the tension in their discussions rises and the true nature of these characters starts to emerge. Timidity, assertion, rationality - all are on display as these men start with a position that they may well not end up with. Ninety minutes seems far too short - but it works very well, rarely coming up for air - but what will their verdict be? Big screen if you can.

As a non-American myself, it's a little tricky for me to understand how well this justice system works. Don't get me wrong, but in my country it is not usual to resort to this type of trials, where the decision depends largely on the lawyers' ability to convince a group of jurors. Here, the decision depends more on the judge, or on a collective of judges. Resorting to a jury trial is provided for in Portuguese law, but must meet a tight set of prerequisites, which turns out to be a very unusual option. So to understand this movie better I had to go read a little bit about how a real life jury trial works. And this is where my doubts about this film are greatest. Is it really a film that respects what really happens in the room where a jury deliberates what sentence to pass? Throughout the film, it is quite clear that the trial did not go well, mainly due to a largely ineffective defense and incapable of securing the interest of the accused (something difficult to admit, especially in a case of capital punishment). Could the jury have done anything about it other than pass sentence? I confess, I don't know. I leave this to the jurists, lawyers and people who can understand more about the subject. The film is a bit like one of those plays that ends up being taken to the cinema: the action takes place overwhelmingly in the same environment, quite confined, and with a limited group of characters who interact with each other and dialogue. Dialogues are an essential part of the film and they are not always nice. It is noted that there is an increase in tensions, and if there are several jurors interested in dismissing the matter and leaving, this changes little by little, as the details are analyzed and doubts about the trial increase. It is a frankly well-written, well-directed film (Sidney Lumet's best) and with a strong and competent cast where Henry Fonda assumes an unequivocal role, giving us one of the best works of his career. Also, Lee J. Cobb deserves a round of applause for the way he interprets and acts, in a deeply caustic character. Every actor has the time and material he needs to do a good job, and they all did. On a technical level, it is an extremely discreet film, largely due to the low budget it was limited to. However, it is one of those films that proves that it is not necessary to have infinite money to do an excellent job. The setting is very believable, but where Lumet shined was in his clever use of cinematography and shooting angles to amplify feelings of confinement or discomfort. Sometimes, the camera gets so close to the actors' faces that we can see how much the excessive heat and subject tension is getting on their nerves."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'James', 'score': '80%', 'review': '.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 59), ('Comedy', 35), ('Thriller', 23), ('Crime', 23), ('Other', 119)]}]",100,Yes!

It’s the kind of movie that lingers with you, not because of its spectacle, but because of the questions it asks and the unforgettable performances it delivers. Chief among those is Heath Ledger’s Joker, a portrayal that reshaped how we see villains. Ledger’s performance as the Joker is nothing short of extraordinary. He’s chaotic and unpredictable, yet his presence is magnetic—every moment he’s on screen feels alive with tension. From his unsettling voice to his haunting laugh, he created a character that’s terrifyingly human yet larger than life. Ledger didn’t just act the part; he became the Joker, and it’s a performance that still sends chills down your spine. It’s no wonder he was awarded a posthumous Oscar—this wasn’t just a role; it was a transformation. Christian Bale continues to bring depth to Bruce Wayne, exploring his inner conflict and the weight of his decisions as Gotham’s protector. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent adds a tragic layer to the story, showing how even the noblest intentions can be corrupted. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman bring warmth and stability to a world teetering on the edge of chaos. What really sets The Dark Knight apart, though, is Nolan’s storytelling. He doesn’t just focus on action—though the film has some of the most intense sequences you’ll see—but on creating a story that makes you think. The way it explores the fragile balance between order and chaos, the cost of heroism, and the power of fear, makes it a deeply compelling watch. Add to that the breathtaking visuals and Hans Zimmer’s score, which pulses with urgency, and you’ve got a film that’s as thrilling as it is thought-provoking. Here’s a fun tidbit: Ledger’s iconic scene where he claps in the jail cell was entirely unscripted. It’s one of those moments that perfectly captures the Joker’s unsettling genius, and it’s all thanks to Ledger’s improvisation. The Dark Knight is a film that deserves all the praise it gets. It’s intense, thoughtful, and unforgettable, with Heath Ledger delivering one of the most iconic performances of all time.

Now having an ""in"" with the wealthy family, the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants. This movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn’t shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don’t feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience’s guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas. However, I do say it’s MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we’ve found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn’t feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren’t surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization! Another aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It’s a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don’t spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don’t have to understand each and every one. That understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn’t essential to it. This film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so.

Only the third film to win both the Palme d\'Or and the Academy Award for Best Picture, after Billy Wilder\'sThe Lost Weekend(1945) and Delbert Mann\'sMarty(1955),Parasiteis one of the best-reviewed films of the century thus far and caused huge waves when it became the first non-English language film to win Best Picture. Co-writer and director Bong Joon-ho also tied with Walt Disney for the most Oscars awarded to one person in one night – four (Best Picture, Best Foreign Language Film, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay). On top of that, he became the first person in history to win more than three Oscars for a single film. In short, Parasite has had a significant, and relatively unexpected, impact. But what exactly isParasite? Described on its official website as a ""pitch-black modern fairy-tale"", even a comprehensive plot summary wouldn\'t adequately delineate its real nature – part comedy of manners, part social satire, part heist film, part thriller, part horror, part family drama, part farce, part economic treatise, part social realism, part tragedy, part allegory. And that\'s just the opening scene! It\'s theUlyssesof cinema, adopting and shedding genres so often and so seamlessly that it effectively becomes its own genre. And, likeUlysses, it\'s exceptional in just about every way – screenplay (co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won), directing, cinematography,mise en scène, editing, production design, sound design, score, acting. There\'s not a weak link here, in a film that achieves that rarest of things – it lives up to the hype. The Kim family are down on their luck. Father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) reside in a tiny basement apartment, with their only window looking out onto a popular urination spot in a back alley. With all four unemployed, they eke out a meagre living folding pizza boxes for a nearby restaurant. However, their fortunes change when Ki-Woo meets Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon), a childhood friend who is now at university. Min-hyuk works as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, but he\'s soon to leave Korea, and so suggests that Ki-Woo take over. Armed with a fake diploma created by Ki-jeong on Photoshop, Ki-Woo successfully applies for the job. The Park family, father Dong-ik, (Lee Sun-kyun), mother Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun), welcomes Ki-woo into their lavish home, and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are, the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Park\'s current domestic staff and take their places. And so, hiding the fact that they\'re all related, Ki-taek is hired as a chauffeur, Chung-Sook as a housekeeper, and Ki-jeong as an art therapist for Da-song. However, it doesn\'t take long before things start to go very, very awry for both families, in ways none of them (or the audience) could ever have imagined. We live in an era where wealth is distributed upwards and the gap between the haves and have-nots is wider than ever. According to inequality.org, the richest 1% of the world\'s population controls 45% of global wealth. At the same time, adults with less than $10,000 capital make up 64% of the population and control less than 1% of the wealth. In 2018, Oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 3.5 billion poorest people. This is themilieuofParasite, a film which taps into some of the same ideological thinking as gave rise to ""Hell Joseon"" sentiments, wherein up to 75% of Koreans aged 19-34 want to leave the country. Obviously enough, Bong\'s main themes are class division and class conflict, the artificiality of societal hierarchy, and the concomitant social inequality and differentiation in status that makes such a hierarchy possible in the first place. As thoroughly entertaining (and funny) as the film is, it remains, in essence, an economic treatise, albeit with a savagely satirical quality. However, make no mistake, this is a satire with teeth – the hilarity and playfulness of the long first act give way to a darker political vibe in the second, before Bong violently deconstructs his own allegory in the emotionally draining and batshit insane third act, ultimately driving the knife home in an epilogue that\'s about as different from the film\'s early scenes as you could imagine. Of course, this is far from the first time Bong has dealt with issues of class, touching obliquely on similar themes inSarinui Chueok[Memories of Murder] (2003),Gwoemul[The Host] (2006), andMadeo[Mother] (2009).Parasite\'s engagement with class and economics, however, is far more overt, aligning it with Bong\'s English-language work,Snowpiercer(2013) andOkja(2015). Never before, however, has he been this caustic, this acerbic, but so too this compassionate, this witty. Indeed,Parasitefeels like a culmination, the film to which he\'s been building for his entire career. In the film\'s press notes, Bong states; I think that one way to portray the continuing polarisation and inequality of our society is as a sad comedy. We are living in an era when capitalism is the reigning order, and we have no other alternative. It\'s not just in Korea, but the entire world faces a situation where the tenets of capitalism cannot be ignored. In the real world, the paths of families like our four unemployed protagonists and the Park family are unlikely ever to cross. The only instance is in matters of employment between classes, as when someone is hired as a tutor or a domestic worker. In such cases there are moments when the two classes come into close enough proximity to feel each other\'s breath. In this film, even though there is no malevolent intention either side, the two classes are pulled into a situation where the slightest slip can lead to fissures and eruptions. In today\'s capitalistic society there are ranks and castes that are invisible to the eye. We keep them disguised and out of sight, and superficially look down on class hierarchies as a relic of the past, but the reality is that there are class lines that cannot be crossed. In this manner, the film works as a literalisation of the theory that co-existence between the various classes is becoming increasingly difficult; the Kims and the Parks aren\'t simply differentiated due to wealth, rather they live in completely different worlds and have vastly different, and largely incompatible, ideologies. One of the most deftly-handled elements of the film is Bong\'s avoidance of the clichés one so often finds in films dealing with economics – the Kims are by no means the default protagonists, a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy, whilst the Parks are by no means the default antagonists, a callous family immediately worthy of scorn. Rather, the Parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the Kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels. Indeed, it\'s the Kims who are the more crassly materialistic of the two families – obsessed with their mobile phones and WhatsApp, we first meet them as they\'re wandering around their apartment, phones held aloft, trying to pick up their neighbour\'s WiFi signal. Later, as they ingratiate themselves with the Parks and acquire more and more access to a wealthy lifestyle, all four Kims start to carry themselves differently, as if being in such proximity to wealth has had a physiological effect. There are no heroes and villains here – Bong is uninterested in trucking in black and white oppositions because such rigid diametrics aren\'t the norm in the real world. For all their scheming and lying, the Kims merely con their way into menial jobs, trying to earn enough to make survival a little easier. As for the Parks, their wealth has insulated them from the world of families such as the Kims, but their greatest crimes are disconnection and ignorance, nothing more. At the same time, the Kims are depicted as a far more unified and loving family than the Parks. Although all four Kims regularly occupy the same frame, to the best of my recollection, we never see the four Parks together in the same shot; Da-hye and Da-song rarely leave their rooms, Yeon-gyo spends most of her time in the kitchen and living room, and Dong-ik is seen most regularly in his car. It\'s a wonderful bit of cinematic shorthand to convey a thematic point, with Bong utilising the visual component of the medium to maximum effect – this is a filmmaker who knows precisely what he\'s doing. It\'s in relation to the two family\'s status as heroes or villains that the film\'s title is so important. Strictly speaking, the Korean title, ""기생충"" (""gisaengchung""), means ""helminth"" rather than ""parasite"", but as a helminth is a parasitic worm, the slight difference in the translation isn\'t a big deal. In any case, a parasitic organism such as a helminth lives in or on a host and takes its nourishment from that host. A simple reading of this is that the Kims are the parasites and the Parks are the hosts, with the Kims feeding off the Parks\' wealth and status. However, in a film where nothing is as it seems, things aren\'t that simple. Bong depicts the Parks as parasites as well – they\'ve been rendered relatively helpless by their wealth, unable to complete basic tasks such as driving or cleaning without the assistant of working-class employees; i.e. they sustain themselves based off of the labour of their servants. And so, just as the Kims feed off the Parks, the Parks feed off the Kims, in what quickly becomes a symbiotic relationship. Concerning this issue, in his Director\'s Statement, Bong says, it is increasingly the case in this sad world that humane relationships based on co-existence or symbiosis cannot hold, and one group is pushed into a parasitic relationship with another. In the midst of such a world, who can point their finger at a struggling family, locked in a fight for survival, and call them parasites? It\'s not that they were parasites from the start. They are our neighbours, friends and colleagues, who have merely been pushed to the edge of a precipice. However, as strong as the film is narratively and thematically, it also has an aesthetic design to die for. Hong Kyung-pyo\'s cinematography, for example, is magnificent. Hong also shot Lee Chang-dong\'s superbBeoning(2018), and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness, gliding through the Parks house like it\'s a fifth member of the Kim family. Lee Ha-jun\'s production design is also praise-worthy, with the Kims\' and Parks\' living conditions contrasted in every way; the Parks live in a pristine post-modernist semi-open plan house, accessible only by an electronically controlled gate, and hidden from the street by tall trees and dense shrubs; the Kims, on the other hand, live in a cluttered and dilapidated apartment with barely any room, their toilet situated beside the aforementioned window looking into an alley. It\'s also in relation to production design wherein one of the film\'s best metaphors is to be found, which is also a great example of just how much of a masterwork this is, how completely Bong is in control of his craft. As a film at least partly in the tradition of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" subgenre (think James Ivory\'sThe Remains of the Dayor Robert Altman\'sGosford Park), Bong literalises the separation between those above and those below insofar as stairways are a recurring motif. The Kims live in a basement apartment without stairs, mirroring their stagnation and inability to rise in a socio-economic sense. On the other hand, the Parks\' lavish home has two main stairways – one going up, the other going down into the cellar. As Ki-jeong and Ki-woo gain more access to Da-song and Da-hye, they start to spend most of their time upstairs. Ki-taek and Chung-sook, however, along with Dong-ik and Yeon-gyo, spend most of their time downstairs, indicating a fissure between the adults and their children. The stairway to the cellar is its own unique animal, with Bong shooting it like he\'s suddenly directing a horror film (there\'s a thematic reason for this that I can\'t go into without spoilers). In this way, he bestows upon it an ominousness that, at first, makes little sense, but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing. There\'s also a third stairway in the Park home, one not revealed until late in the second act, but one which has huge narrative and thematic importance. Parasiteis a masterpiece, with Bong, operating at the peak of his abilities, never putting a foot wrong. It could have been a self-serving and didactic message-movie – a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich – but Bong is far too talented for that, avoiding rhetorical cant, and allowing the film to find its own space. Quite unlike anything I\'ve ever seen, it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy, and so on. This is cinema as art; it\'s the best Palme d\'Or winner since Terrence Malick\'sThe Tree of Lifein 2011 and the best Best Picture winner since Kevin Costner\'sDances with Wolvesin 1990. Bong is currently working with HBO to develop a limited series English-language adaptation, which fills me with dread, but no matter what happens with that project, no matter how good (or bad) it may be, here in 2020, Parasite has proven itself very much a game-changer, a film that deserves every bit of praise it\'s received.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 53), ('Crime', 34), ('Documentary', 34), ('Mystery', 16), ('Other', 73)]}, {'writer': 'Manuel São Bento', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com Yes, I know. I\'m late as hell. I don\'t really have anything to offer you besides my personal opinion. Theses and video essays are breaking down Parasite at such a deep level that I can\'t really write anything new. Nevertheless, I\'ll share my thoughts on it because it would be a massive miss from someone who considers himself as a film critic. I had this movie on my watchlist since last summer, but I kept delaying it, underestimating my time. So, no, I\'m not just watching Parasite because it won Best Picture at the Oscars, I always planned on it. In addition to that, yes, I also love it like most people, and no, I\'m not writing this because I\'m ""following the pack"". Bong Joon Ho simply delivered one of 2019\'s best films, and it\'s definitely cracking a spot in my Top10. I really enjoyed what Bong did with Okja, and I\'m a massive fan of Snowpiercer. Therefore, this isn\'t just another South Korean flick. It\'s directed and co-written by someone who has been proving himself for quite some time. Even though I still defend that Sam Mendes deserved to win Best Director for his work on 1917, I\'m more than happy that a foreign movie finally won Best Picture, and what a film to do it! It can be described as a dark dramedy, but I think social satire is more adequate. The differences between the rich and the poor are beautifully shown on-screen exclusively through visuals. There\'s so little exposition, which is one of the reasons why Parasite has one of 2019\'s best screenplays. The balance between explaining something and leaving it ambiguous is perfect. Throughout the runtime, Bong Joon Ho leans on an actor\'s face so that the audience can understand what that character is feeling through its expressions, which will explain its actions later on. There\'s a sequence that surely has been heavily discussed for the past months. It\'s raining, and Bong cleverly divides the screen with how the wealthy family is dealing with it against the poor neighborhood where the Kim family comes from. The gorgeous cinematography, the unforgettable musical score, the seamless editing... Everything about this sequence is technically flawless, and it carries such an emotionally powerful message. Something astonishing and beautiful to look at for some can be a horrible disaster for others. It\'s a movie that balances a lot of tones. In ten minutes, the tone goes from funny to dramatic to suspenseful to scary to absolute tragedy... and it all feels incredibly realistic. That\'s one of my major compliments to Parasite: I never felt like it was fiction. I never thought ""this is too much, this would never occur"". Even in the third act, where the narrative takes some bold decisions, everything makes sense with what had been shown until then. From shocking character actions to surprising plot points, Bong and Han Jin-won\'s screenplay is excellent. Everyone in the cast is fantastic, but Song Kang-ho is the standout, in my opinion. His role as the father of the Kim family is brilliant. I\'m actually surprised he wasn\'t nominated for Best Actor in more award shows. I created a connection with this family in such a way that the ending truly impacted me. It\'s tough to deny that the writing is what makes Parasite the phenomenon that so many people fell in love with, myself included. Technically, I don\'t have any defects to point out. It\'s one of those films that I firmly believe in having virtually no flaws. I\'m in love with the score, I gasped several times at the impressive cinematography, and the editing is perfect. Whatever genre the story decides to go to, it\'s always entertaining and extremely captivating. Its comedy is very smart, and it made me laugh a lot of times. Its dramatic storylines kept my eyes always focused on what was happening. Even when it briefly delves into the horror territory, it\'s more suspenseful and scary than most of that genre\'s flicks nowadays. All in all, Parasite genuinely surprised me. With so many people hyping it to a ridiculously high level, my expectations were very moderate. Nevertheless, I love it as much or more as everyone else. I know that watching it this late can make some people question my opinion/rating, but I would never love a movie because I ""should"" or because other people do. It deserves every award it received, especially the ones concerning the screenplay. It\'s one of the best original stories of the last few years, and it\'s written in such a brilliant manner, with beautiful visual storytelling instead of the overused exposition. An emotionally resonant message is present throughout the whole runtime, and the various tones are balanced seamlessly. Technically flawless: cinematography, score, editing... everything\'s absolutely perfect. Nothing is placed without purpose. Not a single line of dialogue is wasted. Bong Joon Ho is a phenomenal filmmaker, one that cares about the art and everything that comes with it. He truly put his heart and soul into this, and it would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because it\'s in a foreign language.

Parasite is easily the best movie I've seen since the Big Short. Joon Ho's compelling ease of execution alongside the effortless lure of the plot's trappings had me hooked in an instant. I would have been happy watching this family fold pizza boxes for two hours. The story, like the family, takes on a life of its own, rapidly elevating to a setup impossible to sustain. The Bunuelesque occupy-the-rich scheme gleefully, blissfully ascends to lofty heights only, inevitably, to hit the fatal fan. The poor buggers ultimately find themselves literally chin deep in their own sh*t. The hotsy-totsy aristocrats, meanwhile, host a lovely garden party that flips into a tragic Shakespearean bloodbath. It's all fun and games till someone loses a daughter. (Note to the rich: Check the references of new hires and think twice before inviting riffraff to your afternoon functions). Decades in the making, the implosion of a middle income buffer and a widening disparity between social classes make Parasite a must-see for all income brackets. You don't have to be rich or detest or envy the rich to enjoy this instant classic. But please, whatever you do, don't try this a home, folks.

Jackson), their mob boss & his wife (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a champion boxer who incurs the wrath of the boss (Bruce Willis). The lurid, droll tale is told in a non-linear fashion, but it\'s easy to follow and the final act ties everything up nicely. The dialogue\'s witty and the story maintains your attention, despite its 2 hour and 34 minutes runtime. The film\'s stylish and pulsates with energy and innovation; it understandably influenced many 90\'s films and beyond. I put off seeing this iconic picture until almost twenty years after its release because the protagonists are all big city gangsters or somehow involved with \'em. These are lawless people who would kill a person without batting an eye. Their god is money or hedonism. Let ’em shoot each other to smithereens for all I care. But if you can look beyond this and the constant profanities, the film\'s worth your time. What redeems it for me, besides the all-around entertaining movie-making, is that it\'s a tale of redemption and the high price of stubborn folly: The wise person recognizes God’s grace and responds accordingly while the fool doesn’t and blithely goes on his (doomed) way. Once a person receives grace they naturally extend it to others. There are additional gems spiced throughout. Both Travolta and Jackson shine here. There are several other celebrities on hand, like Harvey Keitel, with many in cameos, e.g. Christopher Walken; not to mention several formidable females, like curvy Julia Sweeney (Raquel), cutie Maria de Medeiros (Fabienne), Angela Jones (Esmarelda) and voluptuous Susan Griffiths (Marilyn Monroe).

Though their manner may be precise, the execution of their tasks are usually more hit and miss, definitely messy - and frequently requiring of the specialist clean-up services of ""Mr. Wolf"" (Harvey Keitel).

It\'s really difficult to make sense of the narrative in writing. It flows really well, but at differing speeds and in several different directions at once. The stories are violent but delivered in an almost tongue-in cheek way. The dance between ""Mia"" and ""Vega"" has become the stuff of cinema legend; there is loads of chemistry - especially between Travolta and an on form Jackson who really does deliver his biblical verses with a puritanical - an lethal - zeal; Willis is as good here as he ever was and you cannot but feel sorry for poor old ""Pumpkin"" (Tim Roth) and his pal ""Honey Bunny"" (Amanda Plummer) whose habit of committing petty robberies when they realise that nobody ever thinks to hit a restaurant, all goes awry.

This was one of the films that consolidated Tarantino\'s career and made him one of the ""superstar"" directors who, whenever he releases a film, whether good or bad, attracts a legion to the cinema. I was never a fan of his, and I don\'t think I will be. He made some films that I liked and others that I hated. I wouldn\'t call it regular, a “safe bet”, but we can\'t deny it, it\'s original, true to his style and doesn\'t seem concerned about pleasing anyone. The film follows more than one plot: we have a couple of violent bandits who try to rob a cafeteria, we have a boxer at the end of his career who has to flee after winning a fight he had agreed he would lose, we have a couple of murderers in the pay of a mobster who are tasked with recovering a stolen suitcase, and we also have the capricious girlfriend of that same mobster, whose boredom forces her darling to assign one of his assassins to babysit for her. What unites them all? In addition to the fact that they naturally intersect, they are all part of the same violent, brutal and marginal universe. For many, this film is one of the best of the 90\'s. I would never consider it as such, that is, for me, an exaggeration. It\'s reasonably good, it\'s gained cult status, it has fans, but it\'s not a masterpiece, not for me. It\'s not a boring film, it doesn\'t tire us out and the various sub-plots are intertwined very well, with skill and elegance. There\'s a lot of violence, heavy slang and drugs, and that can be really hard at times, I felt that too. However, this heavier language, drugs and violence end up being a natural part of the underworld of crime and marginality where the characters move, so it\'s something we can count on right from the start. And there are no sympathetic characters who can arouse some empathy, so it doesn\'t matter to us whether they live or die in the most unpleasant ways (and some of them suffer a lot). These are all qualities, and will be even more valued by those who are more familiar with the “pulp” literary subgenre. I\'m not, it\'s not part of my culture, and I even had to go look it up on the Internet to understand what it was, and what its characteristics were. Despite that, there are a few things about this film that I really didn\'t like or felt over the top. One of them is the dialogues. There are scenes with a lot of dialogues, dialogues without any interest, which can dwell on boring topics, just because. One of them, right at the beginning of the film, is about foot massages, just to give a small example. There are many scenes that seem overly drawn out due to these endless dialogues. I also think the film has too many images of bare feet. Tarantino gained fame as a fetishist, but he always said he wasn\'t… watching this film makes it hard to believe him. And one of the characters, who is a murderer, makes a very long quote from the Bible… it\'s the kind of “literature” that I think an underworld murderer probably wouldn\'t know by heart. The actors are very good, we have several notable names: John Travolta is excellent in the role he was given, with that black suit and his hair soaked in oil. Samuel L. Jackson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman is fantastic. I would say that, at least, Thurman and Travolta achieve performances at the best level of their respective careers in this film. Bruce Willis isn\'t bad, but he\'s just not that interesting. I enjoyed seeing my countrywoman Maria de Medeiros in her only major international role, I\'m sorry she couldn\'t go further, but that\'s life. Tarantino also appears in the film, and it would have been much better if he hadn\'t. He\'s a ham as an actor. Technically, the film has many qualities, starting with the excellent cinematography, with vivid colors and good lighting. There are excellent action scenes, for all tastes, and the soundtrack makes good use of several musical themes that we know very well.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}]",100,Yes!

Probably the most anticipated anime since the final film of Mr. Miyazaki. Because people know what these guys are capable of. This is one per cent sci-fi and 99 per cent fantasy. The concept is not new for us. From 'Freaky Friday' to 'The Lake House', even the recent American television film 'The Swap', you will remember a handful of names once you read this film's synopsis. Yet the film was so good, because of how well the theme was utilised. We all know the technical brilliance of '5 Centimeters Per Second' and the beautiful romance from 'The Garden of Words'. This is an excellent mix of those two. If love either of them, or both, then you will love it as well. But if you ask me, my favourite is still 'The Garden of Words' from this director. I liked this film, enjoyed thoroughly, so liking it less than that means not a bad flick. Surely a film to recommend for anime fans, as well as for animation's (western audience). The story of two teenagers, one from the rural Japan mountain region and the other one from Tokyo. The plot revolves around a comet that is to pass by very close to the earth. But before that event, the girl is bored with her life, so she dreams of living in a big city and that too as a boy. One day her wish comes true when she wakes up as she swapped bodies, including most of the memories with a boy from Tokyo. For her, it is to live as she wanted and make use of the opportunity. But for him, it is like a curse, hence becomes rebellious. This thing keeps happening frequently for days and weeks. After some times, realising the phenomena is between two, they make a deal and strict order of Dos and Don'ts while away. All this until the day of comet and everything changes forever. Searching for the truth and the result of it leads to the end of the tale. ❝Treasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.❞ Unlike Miyazaki, Makot Shinkai's storytelling is quite for the matured audience. It targets adults more than the children. Particularly for not shying away to include naturally occurring events in such situation as the story develops, despite/even though the film revolves around the teens/kids. As for this flick, the concern is not big, but it depends on the nation and its culture you belong to. It is very much acceptable and as the story progress, the best things keep replacing another till the finale. So hooked to it is assured. The film length was good and so the pace of the narration. Well written screenplay, which was based on the book of the same name. But the director admits the inspiration from the previous flicks with similar themes. They have used the real places of the anime version with fictional names, but most of the Tokyo remains same and they all were awesome. In many scenes, the camera panning was a treat. Especially the framerate was high, so no jerks, hence very pleasurable visual experience. Like I mentioned earlier, this is a unique film, despite not a original idea. The film proved the Japan is not overshadowed by Hollywood, particularly after the decline of animes in the recent years. It's up to the quality of the product, if so, then those glory days can be brought back for animes. Anyway, now this film holds the record for highest grossed anime. Apart from technical dominance, the story is also enchanting. If you like romance theme, this will serve you well. A good film for date night. But usually people would skip animation for such occasion and one should not mix up that with anime. Because why I always put apart the anime and animation is, the animes are good at beautiful romance, while its counterpart from the west focus more on comedy and adventure. But the common thing from them is the well explored fantasy theme. Usually the ends are guessable for a film like this and the same case for this in here. Only as a result of the story, you would know what's coming, but not the frame by frame scenes of it. Yeah, I liked this conclusion, the final lines said might bring you tears in your eyes, romantically, if you are an emotional person. One of the best endings, even though it was clichéd.

For three years in a row, Peter Jackson has banished our winter blues with the individual instalments of his Tolkien trilogy, effectively shifting the focus of our cinematic excitement from the summer months to the end of the year. But now that his epic has been unveiled in its entirety, what will be the lasting effects of his achievement? Well, grand-scale fantasy filmmaking is back on the menu, laying down the gauntlet to George Lucas and Star Wars Episode III. Jackson has also proved that notions of risk and ambition needn't be confined to the low-budget, indie end of the spectrum; nor does California have an exclusive stranglehold on groundbreaking special effects. And then there's the DVD factor. Just as The Lord Of The Rings was upping the stakes in theatres, so too was its DVD release pattern defining what can (and should) be done on disc for major movies. In particular, the four-disc extended editions seem to have affected the director's thinking as to what he can get away with in his theatrical final cut. Hence the public grumbles from Christopher Lee about the non-appearance of Saruman in this final instalment. While it might have been fair to grant Lee a curtain call, Jackson quite rightly realises that it is Sauron, not Saruman, whose fiery eye encompasses all the narrative strands of the climax. The Return Of The King marks the first time in the series when Jackson's roots as a horror filmmaker creep through. As the orcs catapult severed Gondorian heads beyond the walls of Minas Tirith, flesh-rotted ghosts draw swords alongside Aragorn and giant spider Shelob stalks Frodo through dark, web-shrouded tunnels, the film pushes the boundaries of its 12A certificate. And so it should, because the look and tone must necessarily grow darker as the Hobbits near Mount Doom and Mordor's evil hand grips Middle-earth ever tighter. Character nuances have been crafted over an unprecedented ten hours-plus of cinematic storytelling: from Strider lurking in the shadowy corner to Aragorn rallying the troops; from Merry and Pippin as bumbling fools to stout-hearted, pint-sized warriors. Only Legolas and Gimli seem to have regressed (in screen time at least) to set-piece archer and comedy sidekick respectively. At least Andy Serkis is rewarded for his Gollum voice work with an early flashback that gets his face on screen, as well as warning us that, under the ring's power, Smeagol can be as murderous as Gollum. Jackson has kept the momentum of the series rolling on and on though the traditionally 'difficult' middle part and 'weak' finale, delivering a climax to the story that's neater and more affecting than what Tolkien managed on the printed page. Some viewers might feel that the director sprinkles some cheese on his extended coda, adding at least one false ending too many (even if he does ignore the book's Scouring of The Shire). But those who have walked beside these heroes every step of the way on such a long journey deserve the emotional pay-off as well as the action peaks, and they will be genuinely touched as the final credits roll. Yes, the Ring is dead. Long live King Kong. Verdict - The resounding climax to a landmark in cinema history. But the King has now returned, the story is over and the ships are leaving Middle-earth. Ladies and gentlemen, Elvish has left the building. 5/5"", 'most_watched_genres': [('Action', 14), ('Adventure', 13), ('Science Fiction', 9), ('Fantasy', 4), ('Other', 3)]}, {'writer': 'Wuchak', 'score': '50%', 'review': ""Too much CGI, redundancy, clichés and drawn out “looks of love” for my tastes. RELEASED 2003 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” adapts the third part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth: Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) continue to try to make their way to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Meanwhile Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom), Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen), King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Faramir (David Wenham) join forces to fight Sauron's army at the stone city of Minas Tirith and, later, draw the forces of Modor out as a distraction for Frodo to accomplish his goal. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are on hand as Hobbits Pippin and Merry. While I’m a casual fantasy/adventure fan and have read numerous books of the genre (e.g. Conan, Tarzan, Gor, etc.), I’ve never read Tokien, likely because I’m not into Hobbits, Elves and Dwarfs. After viewing the three movies, The Lord of the Rings strikes me as a mixture of Robin Hood, Conan and The Wizard of Oz, which all possibly influenced Tolkien’s writing of the Rings trilogy in 1937-1949. So, if you think a meshing of “Conan the Barbarian” (1982) and “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves” (1991) with “The Wizard of Oz” (1939) sounds good, then you’ll probably like these movies more than me. “The Return of the King” is just more of the same showcased in the first two movies, but even LONGER. Take the Battle of Minas Tirith, for example. It’s basically the same as The Battle at Helms Deep in the previous movie, except with colossal elephant-like creatures and the Army of the Dead. These two battles are similar enough that they could’ve been condensed into one conflict. Speaking of the Army of the Dead, this was an interesting new element, as was the horrifying spider-monster that Frodo & Sam face inside the caves. Like the first two movies, the characters are diverse, the tale is creative, there’s a lot of dark action rounded out by softer scenes and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS magnificent. Unfortunately, as with “The Two Towers,” there’s excessive use of CGI (aka CGI porn). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you’ll likely appreciate this installment more than me. There are other problems: While the characters are inspired, they’re also thin and rather uninteresting, at least for mature people who require more depth to hold their attention. Take Legolas (Bloom), for example; we never get to know him. Or consider Aragorn: Mortensen is perfect as the noble warrior, but in the ENTIRE trilogy he probably only has like two full pages of dialog, maybe three. Also, I found the story generally disengaging. I was never much enthralled by the characters and their pursuits, although devotees of Tolkien might be. Then there are WAY too many “looks of love” between characters, particularly Frodo and Sam (I was so happy to see one character get married and have kids, if you catch my drift). There’s also a sense of redundancy, like the aforementioned battles (Helms Deep and Minas Tirith). Or consider the hokey dangling from a cliff by one’s fingers: This was already done with Gandalf at the end of the first part and beginning of the next. Did we really need the entire trilogy to come down to this type of eye-rolling cliché? Another problem is the lack of feminine protagonists. There’s Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden's niece, who becomes infatuated with Aragorn and masquerades as a warrior-ess. Other than that all we have are cameos by Liv Tyler (Arwen), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) and a Hobbit’s wife. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the creators knew enough to throw in a couple of prominent babes as heroines in the story. So did “Conan the Barbarian” and “Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God” (2005). It’s not rocket science. As noted above, the movie’s needlessly overlong and things could’ve been condensed in the trilogy or omitted altogether. When the main storyline ultimately ends at Mount Doom I was thinking there was maybe 12-15 minutes left with half of that time being credits. Nope, there was STILL 30 MINUTES LEFT wherein boring goodbyes and “looks of love” are tacked on. Despite these honest quibbles, “The Return of the King,” and the trilogy in general, was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, particularly those who favor Tolkien, Hobbits, Elves, Gnomes and the like.

Also every line that sounds even remotely cool in the books must be given to Gandalf, no matter who actually said it...  That\'s just frustrating, despite Sir Ian McKellen\'s stellar performance.  With what I would hope is the obvious exception of Orlando Bloom\'s third dismal performance as Legolas, the actors all did quite well; the characters were just not allowed to shine as they do in the books. I see that the common consensus is that this movie is too long, and I agree.  What\'s most frustrating about that to me is that this movie had to finish The Two Towers since that film did not complete, and then this film left out the pivotal ending of the saga.  The Return of the King is actually the shortest volume of the three (there are six books, two in each volume).  As some have noted, the film noticeably scraps the scouring of the Shire, but for those who might have hoped for a fourth installment to finish that story, Peter Jackson dashed all hopes by disturbingly killing off Saruman at the beginning of the extended edition.  By the by, I understand many people feel that the scouring of the Shire is anticlimactic after the final defeat of Sauron, but for myself, I think the point that there is still evil in the world, and that heroes must still rise to fight it, is one of Tolkien\'s triumphs.  Back to my main point, though: the books were shorter while telling more story, because despite his depth and detail, Tolkien understood how to drive  a story along.  Peter Jackson, on the other hand, fails on that count. Anyway, I am someone who always hoped that these movies would be made (I grew up watching the animations produced by Rankin/Bass and Fantasy Films).

The delightful, friendly, rivalry between ""Gimli"" & ""Legolas"" features all too sparingly and it\'s got too ponderous a narrative to sustain the four hours the otherwise visionary Peter Jackson has created. Fortunately, the triple-header quest with Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and a superb Andy Serkis keep the other strand moving along suspensefully and tensely.

He\'s tall, blonde, he smokes a cigar, and he\'s a pig! It\'s debatable of course, since there are legions of fans of the first two films in Sergio Leone\'s Dollars Trology, but with each film there not only came a longer running time, but also a rise in quality - debatable of course! Here for the third and final part of the trilogy, Leone adds Eli Wallach to the established pairing of Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood, and brings all his tools of the trade to the party. Plot is slight, the three principals are on a collision course to find some buried gold, with each man having varying degrees of scuzziness, so how will it pan out? Such is the genius of the narrative, it\'s a fascinating journey to undertake. The characterisations are ripe and considered, the various traits and peccadilloes beautifully enhanced, and with Leone being Leone, there\'s no shortage of cruelty and humour. He also brings his style, the close ups, long shots and some outstanding framing of characters in various situations. The story encompasses The Civil War, which pitches our leads into ""The Battle of Branston Bridge"", where here we get to see just how great Leone was at constructing full on battle sequences. It\'s exciting, thrilling and literally dynamite, whilst Aldo Giuffrè as Captain Clinton turns in some memorable support. The Euro locations pass muster as the Wild West, superbly photographed by Tonino Delli Colli, and then of course there is Ennio Morricone\'s musical compositions. It\'s a score that has become as iconic as Eastwood\'s Man With No Name, a part of pop culture for ever more. It mocks the characters at times, energises them at others, whilst always us the audience are aurally gripped. There\'s obviously some daft coincidences, this is after all pasta world, and the near three hour run time could be construed as indulgent. But here\'s the thing, those who love The Good, The Bad and the Ugly could quite easily stand for another hour of Leone\'s classic. I mean, more barbed dialogue, brutal violence and fun! Great, surely!

Clint Eastwood is the Good, aka the Man with No Name, a taciturn wanderer who follows his own sense of justice. His opposite is Angel Eyes (Lee van Cleef), the Bad, a brutal mercenary who kills anyone who stands in the way of making ready cash. The film\'s comic relief is Tuco (Eli Wallach), the Ugly, a Mexican bandit wanted in several states who ends up inadvertently doing some good turns. At the height of the Civil War, as Union and Confederate armies battle each other in the West, these three men vie for an abandoned cache of gold coins. The film is especially memorable for its pace and cinematography. The opening scene, for example, juxtaposes closeups of anxious faces with vast panoramas of the Western landscape, and 10 minutes passes before a single word is said. It is like Tarkovsky transplanted to a vastly different setting. That\'s not to say it\'s all so serious, though. In a sense the film is a ""two buddies on the road"" movie, with Tuco the wisecracker and Eastwood\'s character the straight man. It is also a war film, with Leone apparently sparing no expense in presenting a realistic image of hundreds of men charging each other on the battlefield. This is not among the greatest films I\'ve ever seen, but it\'s very well-made. Because this is a ""spaghetti Western"", an effort in the genre realized by a joint Italian-Spanish production team with American lead actors, the film has some curious qualities. Because of the use of locals, all the faces of Civil War soldiers are so clearly Italian, even though Italian immigration into the US picked up only later. The Mexican bandit Tuco is played by a Jew from New York, and furthermore Leone mocks the character\'s Catholicism in a way that Americans of the era would, although the faith would be in no way foreign to his Italian audience.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 78), ('Comedy', 27), ('Romance', 22), ('Documentary', 13), ('Other', 53)]}, {'writer': 'Peter McGinn', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'I am not a fan of Sergio Leone.

In one review I read, he was criticized for staying with facial close-ups too long, and I would probably agree if he populated his movies with beautiful actors and actresses as many films do, but he relies heavily upon actors with interesting faces. Sometimes I feel he relies on too many shootings, and on having his gunfighters be too damn good. Two, four, six opponents? Doesn’t matter, these guys kill them all and come out unscathed.  But that is part of the western movie gunfighter mystique. On a different level, I have owned the soundtrack for this movie: The Good the Bad and the Ugly, for close to 50 years. I write novels in my spare time, and I started listening to this soundtrack (plus others like Thunderball) for background music as I wrote. I moved on to Ambient music, such as Brian Eno, but still listen to this album. As a side note, I heard a great version of this movie music on YouTube, performed by the Danish National Orchestra.

And that word is “transcendent”. This movie is not only the pinnacle of the Spaghetti Western, but it transcended into the pinnacle of the Western genre in itself. It’s safe to say it transcends that too, and can be considered one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking ever. It counts with memorable performances by three different leads, a story that breaks the “black and white” concepts of morale, and an original score that can only be defined by the word “epic”. Directed by the man responsible for the revitalization of the western in Italy, Sergio Leone, the film does an incredible job of introducing every character, and showing each and every one has a dubious concept of moral values. “The Bad”, Sentenza, or Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), is shown to be a ruthless, greedy gun for hire, but also someone who lives by the mantra of always getting the job done. “The Ugly”, Tuco, is a  greedy backstabber, but he is also a man who comes from an extremely poor environment and family conflicts, showing a bit of determinism in the film. “The Good”, Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is not much better himself. While he is surely the less greedy one, he also has no problem with killing and backstabbing other people. To put it in perspective, he is ironically announced as “The Good” right after abandoning a man to die in the desert. The story follows all these three personalities as they engage in their particular gold rush: a buried treasure that is hidden in a cemetery. In order to find it, they must form an uneasy alliance, while trying to outrun each other, and claim the prized gold alone. All of this while the Civil War happens around them. The performances are nothing short of amazing. It goes to show the range that Lee Van Cleef had once this villainous role is compared to his work in the previous installment of the trilogy, For a Few Dollars More, as a heroic, friendly and almost fatherly figure. His presence is as intimidating as ever, and one of the best he has given in his lengthy career. Eastwood is as eye-catching as one would expect: his deep stares and lines delivered in a whispery, yet gravelly voice, defined The Man With No Name. But the best of the bunch has to be Eli Wallach. His comedic timing is as precise as any bullet shot in this film. But the most outstanding part of his characterization is that while he is extremely funny, he also manages to be a credible threat for the “hero”, Blondie. The original music score for this film deserves a whole book just to talk about it, and it still wouldn’t do it justice. It’s simply a lesson by the maestro, Ennio Morricone, on how music can change a film. Thanks to a track such as L’estasi dell’oro (The Ecstasy of Gold), a man running around a cemetery becomes one of the most epic scenes ever made. Thanks to a composition such as Il Triello, three men staring at each other, pondering their options for almost seven minutes straight, becomes tense enough to have the viewer on the edge of its seat. There is simply no other way to put it: Morricone crafted one of the best scores in this art’s history. At the end of the day, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is more than just a great western film. It’s a show of great acting, writing, directing and music scoring. It’s a real once in a lifetime classic, that has been around for a long time, and not aged a little bit, and will still be talked about for generations of cinephiles to come.

More than a classic, it's mandatory. I'm not an expert nor do I want to sound like one, but I think this is one of the most famous western films ever made, despite being shot by an Italian director and being more European than American. Sérgio Leone was one of the most notable directors of his time and he left us, in this film, one of his masterpieces. This is one of those movies that is almost perfect. Problems and failures are scarce and reside in minimal details that end up not making a big difference in the overall work. The story was very well written and takes place in the midst of the American Civil War, a time when violence was part of everyday life. In this environment of violence and mutual distrust, two men are looking for a treasure buried in a cemetery: the problem is the fact that each one knows only part of the location (that is, one knows the location of the cemetery and the other knows which grave it is) and there is a third man, a fearsome assassin, willing to do anything to take all the gold. For this film, Leone put together a very reasonable cast, mostly European, and three great North American actors with enormous talent: Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. I believe that they knew how to make the most intelligent and skilful use of this film, giving us a truly remarkable job. For this three actors, this is the best cinematographic work of their career, or one of the best, consecrating them as great Western movies actors. The film, however, seems to give Wallach more and better opportunities. While watching it, I got the feeling that he is the actor who receives most attention and best material, in addition to having known how to improvise at the right moments and in creative and intelligent ways. The film has great visual beauty, emphasized by the cinematography, the filming work and the good choice and design of sets and costumes. At a time when the correct period recreation was something that cinema sometimes blatantly ignored, this film did the opposite, giving us a realistic and believable vision of the past and placing the film in a specific place and time. I'm not saying it was a one hundred percent successful effort, but it was definitely a decisive step in the right direction when it comes to period films. The special effects and visuals are excellent, the best there was then, and the whole film has an epic, grandiose, expensive feel. It is also very long, with almost three hours in length, but it is worth not being afraid or giving up on because of that. Being a Western film, it is quite evident that there is a lot of violence, so it is not a film for children. Even so, it is not gratuitous violence. Finally, we owe Ennio Morricone a salute for the excellent soundtrack he composed. Among his vast work, this is not my favorite nor the best, but it is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable and iconic pieces, a work that we know, even without having seen this film, and that has become part of our collective memory.

Don’t talk. 70% (ish) This is the third in a so-called ‘trilogy’, a framing which I expressed doubts about in my review for the second in the sequence, “For a few dollars more”. So, from my perspective it’s a matter of complete indifference as to how many in this ‘trilogy’ you see and in what order you watch them. That being said, if you watch all three films you will observe the tropes that are common to this ‘trilogy’. In this one the plot concerns three men on the make who end up chasing a fortune in gold during the American Civil War (American history is not my forte, so looking at Wikipedia for the span of this war, I’d guess that it takes place towards the tail end of it, in the mid 1860s). The three men on the make are referred to in the film’s title. Skim reading Wikipedia’s entry for this film, there is an interesting thing to note about the title: “In the theatrical trailer, Angel Eyes is referred to as The Ugly and Tuco, The Bad. This is due to a translation error; the original Italian title translates to ""The Good [one], the Ugly [one], the Bad [one]""”. That quote misses ‘the good one’, which, in this case, is Clint Eastwood’s character of ‘Blondie’. I’m using scare quotes for his name because it’s a nickname and also a trope of this trilogy, in that he always plays a character whose name we aren’t sure of, whether we think we know it or not. Lee Van Cleef plays ‘the ugly one’ and Eli Wallach plays ‘the bad one’. “The good, the bad and the ugly” returns to the opening title style of the first film, “A fistful of dollars”, initially, at least. Here you’ll get Ennio Morricone’s famous composition which is, musically, at least, his most accomplished, as in you’d want to get the soundtrack for this film because it is so good as a piece of music (it’s an earworm!). His score for the previous film worked better as a soundtrack for a film, as in it heightened tension or what have you. When Eastwood’s character is revealed (or at least the back of his head, while he is smoking), that famous score plays. That seemed to tie it to him but it would later repeat for the character of Tuco. I’m not sure what we are meant to glean from the fact that the phrase “Directed by Sergio Leone” is in three different fonts! The opening titles have a letterbox aspect which is dropped for the rest of the film, as was the case with the earlier films. Back to the tropes of this film, there is the visual style of Eastwood. It looked as though his stylistic trope of wearing a poncho would not occur in this film but it did towards the end. As I noted for Eastwood’s character in the previous film, I would say the same thing about Lee Van Cleef’s character for this one: he’s not the same person in both films. Once again you eventually get something resembling a visual trope for him, after thinking it wouldn’t occur: his pipe smoking. Lastly, going on the two previous films, you would expect there to be a main villain of the piece. Maybe I thought it was (or might be) Gian Maria Volonté but he is ‘replaced’ by Eli Wallach. Wikipedia does mention that Volonté was considered for the role but Leone wanted to cast someone who could add a different dimension to the character. Having him in all three films would have made for interesting processing of what this kind of casting means for the trilogy. In any case, perhaps it’s a nice symmetry with Eastwood being the constant and Volonté and Van Cleef being either side of the trilogy for two films. Some of the dialogue in this film did catch my attention, as it did in the first film. Both of these films would make good material for a high school subject like history or media studies or what have you. Amongst the meaty dialogue in this film are lines like: (an official reading the charges against a condemned man) “raping a virgin of the white race; statutory rape of a minor of the black race”; a business man speaks of the Confederates: “as soon as these cowards hear a blue shirt is around, they run. These rebels have no will to fight. They’ll soon be finished. We get rid of these bastards, then we begin making money on those Yankees. They carry gold, not paper dollars and they’re going to defeat the South”; a Confederate sergeant says: “the only thing we care about is saving our own hides”. In my reviews I’ve noted the sense of humour of Eastwood’s characters. In the first film it is playful. In the second it is guarded (maybe I should have used that word there!). Here it is cruel (in an early scene). This is just another demonstration to me that Eastwood is not playing the same character in all three films. Of all the three films, Eastwood’s character is the most unpleasant here, which makes his designation as “the good” (in a postmodern fashion by Leone, using on-screen text) as seemingly ironic. When he calls Tuco a “greasy rat”, it makes me wonder if there is an ethnic dimension to the choice of villains in all three films. That might be a meta observation of the trilogy by me though. Some of the humour isn’t intended as cruel though. For instance, there is a funny scene where ‘Blondie’ and Tuco wonder what side of the civil war an approaching cavalry is on. Another scene with Tuco, in a prison camp, brought to mind a scene in the film Pretty Woman, which was played for laughs. ‘Blondie’ is definitely a dodgy character and his scheme at the start of the film is novel (to me) although I do wonder about continuity errors as far as his partner in crime goes. Their seemingly first meeting doesn’t really square with what happens later. How Blondie is seen to become partners in crime with this person also illustrates how odious his character is. Another major aspect of this film is its depiction of war. It made me question whether it was being used a prop. Is what the film saying about war merely glib? War isn’t glorified here in any case. Perhaps it’s not odd that I found some scenes of war being taken to a town had echoes in what is currently happening around the world. The makeup used to depict war injuries strikes me as having a realistic look to it. In a more oblique manner, I did note the use of targets in a shooting range looking like Native Americans. It’s such a throwaway moment but it struck me, as did similar moments in the first film, concerning Native Americans. Of the three films in this ‘trilogy’, this is the one that I’m scoring the lowest. All of the films had their moments which strained credulity or buggered belief. It’s just that for this one, it really went beyond pushing the envelope for me. Even though Eastwood’s character’s entrance into the final showdown of the first film was unbelievable, I still found it satisfying for its mythic quality. This unbelievability just increases from film to film in an unsatisfying way. One example of that is the depiction of the captain at Branson Bridge. His behaviour just didn’t seem grounded in reality. I’m not including the fact that he looks swarthy, as do most of the soldiers on the Confederate side, for some reason. It was filmed in Europe, especially Spain, so I won’t hold that against them. Generally speaking, I just didn’t find the main characters believable in how they related to one another, given their history. As a side note, this film had a non-linear feel to it but I suppose that the ugly one’s search for Carson is a thread. Of the ‘trilogy’, I’d say that the first is the one that I’d most likely revisit again sometime. The second one, maybe, after a long absence. The third film is much longer but it’s not for that reason that it doesn’t feel to me like something that I’d be interested in revisiting, although it does have its moments. My thoughts on what I should score this range from 75% (no + sign meaning I give it 7 out of 10 stars on a site where you can’t give half stars) to maybe 67.5% if I’m feeling unaccommodating. 72.5% or 72.5+% isn’t unreasonable but maybe I’ll just stick to what this site gives me, 7 out 10 stars? Random notes: ^ I viewed the “Extended English language version” which had a “2003 restoration and remastering”. Recorded on 11/10/2024. SBS World Movies, 9:55pm. Running time of 2:51:15 without the six lots of ads during the film (measured from the start of the MGM lion’s roar to to the end, being after the trademark still of the lion, which, for the first time, didn’t have a lion’s roar), which brings the running time up to 3:11:51. I must say that I appreciated the fact that SBS didn’t play ads during the lead up to the ending (the last ad ended 2:26:04 on the unedited film). Audio Described and Closed Captions. It was rated M for adult themes and violence. I viewed this film over two days, from 23/11/2024 and made these notes. I started writing this review on 07/12/2024 up to here and a bit more. Another first for this trilogy is the inclusion of end credits. ^ The option for Closed Captions was appreciated by me but I still found an online site with the script to refer to at times. SBS’ captions (I presume it was theirs) were good. For instance, whilst the online site didn’t include Spanish utterances, SBS’ did and I got a strong language translation when I typed it into a translation app on my PC. Sometimes the online script had words which the CC didn’t. Sometimes the online script had the right word and the CC didn’t. ^ Once again, I hear what sort of sounds like words in Morricone’s score, in this case “Go, go, go, echo”. He has actually composed music which features lyrics for this film: “The story of a soldier” and those lyrics were written by Tommie Connor. ^ Not sure if Tuco’s sign of the cross is correct...which might be the point, perhaps. ^ Interesting casting for the first character we come across called “Shorty”. I wonder what his story was. Wikipedia doesn’t answer that question but interestingly I see that he is yet another actor who has appeared elsewhere in this trilogy...and you’d think that I would have definitely remembered seeing him before! ^ Lee Van Cleef seems to have at least one thing in common with Dave Allen...part of his finger is missing! Anyway, it’s interesting that the film delays returning actor’s props from the previous films in the trilogy: Eastwood starts out wearing a trench coat in this film before taking a poncho at the end (by the way, I liked the cinematography of that scene at the cemetery with Tuco) and Van Cleef is only later seen with a smoking pipe. This review submitted late 11/12/2024, AEST. P.S. Having now looked at the ponchos in all three films, it looks to me that they are the same. Now, maybe this style of poncho was ten a penny back in the day but it seems to me that this stylistic thread between all three films...and I\'m not sure what it\'s meant to signify...because I\'m not treating all the characters that Clint Eastwood plays as being the same person.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Action', 46), ('Adventure', 41), ('Science Fiction', 30), ('Drama', 29), ('Other', 116)]}]",100,Yes!

Well, I have to start this text with a note that I believe is relevant to understand what I'm going to write: this was the first Japanese film that I remember seeing. I might even be forgetting something I've seen before, but I don't think so. Therefore, I'm not a good connoisseur of Japanese cinema, so I don't want my opinion to be taken with any authority that I don't crave. I know there are people who want that. I do not. I speak, as in any of my reviews, only through my mouth, from the height of my meager wisdom, without pretensions. I may be right about some things, wrong about others, but that's the most normal thing in the world. I decided to see this film because it was highly recommended and well regarded… everyone said it was a very good film, so I decided to see it for myself. I just finished it, and read a little about the film and its director, the famous Akira Kurosawa. The film is really a work that is above average, but it is not the kind of film that pleases everyone, and it seems to me to be a little overvalued, which results in damage. I say this because I felt, at various times, that the film failed to meet my expectations, as I am quite neutral, that is, I neither love this type of film nor feel repugnance in watching it. The script takes place, roughly, in the mid-16th century, when Japan was divided into feuds and kingdoms, and there were frequent internecine wars in which the samurai took part. Of course, in such an environment, it is the common people who sacrifice themselves, and the humblest have always been the most susceptible to abuse by the powerful. That's what we have here, with a rural village that is regularly looted and devastated by an armed band until it decides to hire a small group of wandering samurai to help defend it. They achieve this objective, and we are invited to see all the labors that occur in the preparation of the defense, and in the martial training of those peasants. I'm going to do it differently, and start by saying the aspects that seemed most positive to me. First, it seems to me that Kurosawa is really meticulous in the work he has done and has great affection and respect for his country's traditions and history. Otherwise, one would not understand the effort and money that were tied up in a film with such a historical and cultural load. To what extent did his taste for realism influence European cinema, or vice versa? I'm sure there are film students who have discussed this. What I can guarantee is the commitment to realism, visible, for example, in the extraordinary design of the sets and costumes, and in the static cinematography, very elegant and sharp. The script is quite solid, and gives us an extraordinarily credible story and very well-built and striking characters. I don't know the actors well, but I think Toshiro Mifune deserves applause for the commitment and work he has done here. He is an actor who naturally captures our attention and has a charisma that comes through effortlessly. On the negative side, however, we also have several aspects to point out, starting with the length of the film, with more than three and a half hours. I'm sorry to say, but I feel that the script didn't justify that much time, and that Kurosawa didn't work the pace well. With a more restricted edition, he would have managed to reduce the film, without much loss, to two hours, and make it less heavy and exhausting. We don't need to see every village debate or every military training shenanigans. I also didn't like the attempts at humor introduced in the film. They just weren't funny at all. The excessive predictability of the story told also turns out to be a defect. I also didn't like the virtual absence of a soundtrack. I've seen that in other films, and I've never been particularly fond of that stylistic device."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'Kenneth Blais', 'score': '100%', 'review': ""At the top of my favorite films ever.

Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother. As we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience. It all begins like Shyamalan's 'Signs' movie with a family living surrounded by corn field. Then switches to 'The Astronaut Farmer' and going through 'Gravity', finally meets the 'Inception'. It was just a reference to call the movie setting that brings constant change for every half an hour. Like the opening scene and the end scene had over a 100 years difference. As I earlier said it was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well. The first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction. There are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'. ‘‘This world's a treasure,\nbut it's been telling us to leave for a while now.’’ All the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the majority of the screen space in the story presentation. There's no ruling out the fine performance executions from Anne Hathaway and the young star from the Twilight movie, Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was having less scope which were like the guest appearances that was widened a little broader, but was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one. Remember the movie 'Contact', a lovely movie, which was ruined by its fictional ending. Something like that happened in this film as well. The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble. Anyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way. I could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science-fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film. If you had seen enough movies before like this one, you can recall your memories like the Tom Hanks parts from 'Cloud Atlas'. But still independently stands strong and falls in a never seen before category. ‘‘Maybe we've spent too long\ntrying to figure all this out with theory.’’ The end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I. The visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films. It will become a talk of the week, perhaps month all over the world, so don't leave behind when your friends talk about it. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 58), ('Comedy', 42), ('Romance', 22), ('Family', 18), ('Other', 104)]}, {'writer': 'decovision', 'score': '95%', 'review': ""People seem to think that if you enjoy a Christopher Nolan movie, you are a fanboy and the film couldn't really be that good.

And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again. This movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan\'s recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn\'t felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I\'ll say this though, If it works for you, you\'ll be in heaven. The premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father-Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too. Mathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded. Interstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which \'Time\' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I\'m actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan\'s tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets. The visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer\'s best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn\'t had a clue about my surroundings. I didn\'t want those scenes to end. Alas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer onscreen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it. With all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these.

Many didn't find its overall message - that love is the most powerful force in the universe which transcends space and time - to be very appealing, but I thought it was an interesting take on special relativity and how two people can be bound by a common feeling, even when they're in different parts of the universe at different times. I also thought the acting was believable, for the most part, and I didn't think anyone was miscast. I enjoyed the surprise appearance from a certain famous actor about halfway through. But what really blew me away were the visuals and the soundtrack. I believe it was Quentin Tarantino who once said movies and music go hand in hand; that a moving image complimented by the right piece of music can create art. Well, the visuals in this film, which took my breath away, and the score, which perfectly captured the 'feel' of the cosmos and all its wonder, proved him right. I think this was Hans Zimmer's best work yet, and although I'm not Christopher Nolan's biggest fan, I will continue to follow his work if he can pull off more movies like this.

Needless to say I did not really like this movie. The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either. Be warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two. The movie starts of with the usual “I told you so” wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f…? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience. The story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a “save the human race” mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense! The movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie. The movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still…) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design? The one good thing I can say about this movie is that the performance of most of the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey, are quite good.

Now most people or critics have said that last third of this movie ruined the movie for them, but I actually like the ending to the movie. It\'s new for Nolan because he always ends on a deep and cold note, but this movie didn\'t and I didn\'t mind it.

Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are the only character\'s that to me were interesting and I cared for them, but the rest of the character\'s I didn\'t really care for.

It\'s a breathtaking exploration of humanity\'s yearning for survival, the profound power of love, and the awe-inspiring mysteries of the universe. The film\'s greatest strength lies in its seamless blend of a deeply personal story with cutting-edge scientific concepts. We follow Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot turned farmer, who is chosen to lead a mission to find a new home for humanity. The film doesn\'t shy away from complex scientific ideas like wormholes, black holes, and the theory of relativity, but it presents them in a way that is both accessible and captivating. The scene where Cooper encounters his aged daughter while he himself remains relatively young is a poignant example of how the film masterfully intertwines science and emotion, leaving viewers pondering the nature of time and the enduring power of familial bonds. ""Interstellar"" is not for the casual viewer. It demands attention, patience, and a willingness to engage with complex ideas. The film\'s pacing is deliberate, its visuals are stunningly immersive, and its themes are profound. It\'s a film that rewards repeated viewings, as each watch unveils new layers of meaning and scientific detail. The film\'s impact is further amplified by Hans Zimmer\'s haunting score, which perfectly captures the vastness of space and the weight of humanity\'s fate. Nolan\'s direction is masterful, creating a sense of awe and wonder that is both captivating and emotionally resonant. McConaughey delivers a nuanced performance as Cooper, a man grappling with the weight of his mission and the sacrifices he must make. The supporting cast, including Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, also deliver compelling performances that further elevate the film\'s emotional impact. ""Interstellar"" is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll. It\'s a testament to the power of human ingenuity, the enduring nature of love, and the endless possibilities that lie beyond our planet.

It’s not just a movie, it’s an experience. The performances by the actors were amazing. Matthew McConaughey as Cooper really made me feel every bit of his emotions; his love for his kids, his struggle, and his determination to save humanity. Anne Hathaway also nailed her role, and Jessica Chastain, as adult Murph, was just perfect. Even the smaller roles added so much depth to the movie. It felt like everyone gave their absolute best. Christopher Nolan’s direction? Flawless. You can see how much thought and care he put into every part of the movie. The production was top-notch, and the visuals of space were breathtaking. Even the robots, TARS and CASE, felt real and practical, not just fancy CGI. Fun fact: those robots were real models controlled by an actor, which is crazy to think about! The black hole, Gargantua, was also scientifically accurate thanks to physicist Kip Thorne, and it looked stunning on screen. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer deserves its own shoutout. The way he used the church organ and ticking sounds created a mood that’s unforgettable. It felt like the music was alive and part of the story, pulling me deeper into every scene. The movie also taught me things. I love how it’s based on real science, like time dilation and wormholes, but it doesn’t feel boring or like a science lesson. Instead, it made me curious and left me thinking long after it ended. One thing that stood out for me is how the movie shows the power of love and connection. The relationship between Cooper and his daughter Murph was the heart of the story for me. It reminded me that even in the vastness of space, what truly matters are the people we care about. ""Interstellar"" isn’t just about saving the world; it’s about what it means to be human. Watching it makes you think about big questions: Why are we here? What’s our purpose? And how far are we willing to go for the ones we love? It’s rare to find a movie that’s this entertaining, emotional, and thought-provoking all at the same time. This is the kind of movie I could watch over and over again and still find new details to appreciate.

Therefore, this week I’m reviewing five of Fincher’s movies. Se7en was the first one, and now it’s time for one of the most culturally impactful films of the 90s, Fight Club. This is another rewatch of another filmmaking classic, one that I was never able to absolutely adore like most people. When this movie came out in 1999, critics were extremely divided, and the film failed at the box office. With time, it gained a cult following through home media, but it’s still considered a very controversial piece of cinema. So, nothing new, having in mind Fincher is at the helm. Despite this being my third or fourth time experiencing this story, I never really changed my opinion about it, which is a bit uncommon in my viewing history. Usually, after multiple rewatches, my overall thoughts about a movie slightly vary, but Fight Club is one of the few exceptions. I believe my opinion remains intact from the very first watch. I really enjoy this film, but I can’t state that I absolutely love it. Since this is a special case, I’m going to start with what still bothers me after so many viewings, something I also rarely do in my reviews since I always leave the bad stuff to the end of the article. Without spoiling anything, of course, there’s a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution, but never by its impact on the narrative. Jim Uhls’ screenplay relies on the main characters’ friendship to carry the story forward, and throughout the first two acts, Fincher leaves not-that-subtle hints to a massive revelation, which eventually triggers the beginning of the third act. This major plot point is brilliantly executed, and I still feel incredibly fascinated by its delivery, both in terms of the dialogue and the performances. However, its impact on any lightly focused, observant viewer is close to zero due to the clear evidence that pointed towards this development. Now, I don’t want to sound like that stereotypical moviegoer that says, “I guessed the twist before its revelation, hence it all sucks”. Like I insinuate above, I was still wholly captivated during the entirety of the third act. Nevertheless, Fight Club’s runtime is far from being short, and Fincher spends a lot of time building up an idea that loses its surprise factor even before the film’s midpoint. It changes the protagonist’s perspective, it takes the viewer through a predictable yet entertaining path, setting up a powerful, meaningful ending. However, personally, I don’t feel like the time spent in the first two acts was satisfyingly compensated in the end… at least, not in its entirety. The second act also has a short period where it loses a bit of steam due to some repetitive sequences and an unnecessary amount of flashbacks. Again, I feel like Fincher didn’t completely trust the audience back then, contrary to his procedure in Se7en. In the latter flick, Fincher left the biggest responsibility to the viewer’s imagination, leaving the murder scenes for the audience to picture in their minds. In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there’s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.

In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there’s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer. Don’t worry, I’m done with the negatives, and don’t forget: I really, really like this movie. Obviously, Fincher and Uhls created a story packed with underlying themes and social commentary. From the whole consumerism theory to the more psychological component regarding Edward Norton’s mental state, every message is seamlessly communicated to the audience. I’ve also been through a point in my life where I wish I’d be someone else, someone who had already achieved every dream of mine successfully with an overwhelming feeling of fulfillment. Coping with the inability to become that perfect someone can become an excruciating, sad, depressing process, and it varies drastically from person to person. Fight Club approaches mental health and people’s acceptance of who they truly are in a groundbreaking manner, capturing Edward Norton’s emotions perfectly and broadcasting his thoughts through some of the best narration in the history of cinema. Its take on the world of consumerism is undoubtedly interesting and plays a big part in the climax of the film. Despite the issues described above, Uhls’ screenplay is very well-written, elevating the conversations between Norton and Brad Pitt (Ad Astra, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), which are indeed remarkably entertaining. Predictable or not, the main story is wonderfully executed by Fincher, who continues to demonstrate his impressive technical attributes. Once again, the pre-production phase is proved here to be as important as any other stage in the filmmaking process. Fincher’s dedication to his features is palpable and visible on-screen through every single technical aspect. This time, Fincher brought in Jeff Cronenweth as the director of photography, and both worked together to not only create that desaturated, realistic atmosphere that Fincher loves so much but also to deliver the brutal, violent, bloody fight scenes that keep the entertainment levels at their highest. With clean, consistent, coherent editing from James Haygood, the movie flows beautifully despite its lengthy runtime. The Dust Brothers’ score is quite alternative, which suits the also unconventional storytelling. Last but not least, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. I know it’s incredibly cliche to write that two actors share impeccable chemistry, but Norton and Pitt take it to a whole other level. In two physically-demanding displays, both actors deliver award-worthy performances that marked their careers. Pitt offers one of his most underrated portrayals, being extremely funny throughout the entire film, but also astonishingly badass, carrying his fight sequences as amazing as he does with his dialogues. On the other hand, seeing Norton go all-out is a terrific experience. I lack words to describe such an emotionally compelling interpretation, filled with powerful character moments. A final word of praise to Helena Bonham Carter (Enola Holmes), who also delivers an exceptional performance. In the end, Fight Club is and will probably remain David Fincher’s most controversial movie for a long, long time. With an absolutely brilliant direction and execution, Fincher uses Jim Uhls’ captivating, layered, unconventional screenplay to tackle themes such as consumerism, society’s behavior, and mental health, seamlessly transmitting meaningful yet contentious messages. Once again, the filmmaking in display is technically flawless, going from the trademark authentic cinematography and production design to the unique score, all flowing superbly through excellent editing. Unfortunately, I don’t belong to the group of people who utterly love this film. The excessive (sometimes unnecessary) use of flashbacks doesn’t help, but it’s the enormous build-up packed with overly explicit clues to a significant (yet unsurprising) plot twist that ends up partially ruining the viewing for me. I also wish that the script developed a few plot points more ambiguously, but Brad Pitt and Edward Norton elevate the whole movie so much with their ridiculously outstanding performances that these small issues don’t keep me away from highly recommending one of the most memorable, iconic films of all-time.

They start an underground club where men get together and vent their frustrations by beating the crap out of each other. ""Fight Club"" (1999) has a huge reputation as a stylish cult flick and is often ranked with the greatest films ever made. The first half is entertaining enough, both quirky and amusing; and I like the interesting themes explored: Escaping the maternal and material, being a slave to advertising, rebelling against life-stifling conformity, being a blind follower of a charismatic leader, finding your inner wild-man, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Cool, the nature of lawless “revolutionaries” (which is too reminiscent of ANTIFA thugs), the struggle with homosexuality interpretation, etc. That’s all highly commendable. Unfortunately, the second half isn’t compelling. I sat there bored and couldn’t wait for it to end. “Donnie Darko” (2001) had the same problem – promising set-up with clever ideas, but a tedious wrap-up. Meanwhile the twist that everyone gushes over is actually underwhelming and not very surprising, although it’s relatively interesting. Moreover, watching guys get radically beat up is only entertaining a couple times; after that it gets redundant. Speaking of which, how exactly does bare-knuckled fighting inspire or enlighten? Does it really help one’s life to have missing teeth, black eyes and other assorted injuries? Of course the movie doesn’t emphasize the long-lasting negative effects of regular brawling. Have you ever met a brawler, boxer or professional football player in his 50s with the perpetual aches & pains? Cult flicks like “Pulp Fiction” (1994) deserve the praise and stand the test of time; this one disappoints mainly due to the curiously dull second half.

It\'s not quite so difficult to guess what the denouement will deliver, but it\'s a journey filled with violence (who\'d be Jared Leto?), but it\'s increasingly used more as if it were a steam valve for something much more psychologically demanding.

It's like a modern fairy tale, showing us the fascinating side of cinema and reminding us why we love it. Of course, everything passes, and cinema has gone through many phases, it has undergone metamorphoses, and the end of the great classic movie theaters was one of them. And now? The pandemic has shown us that cinema can learn to survive without its theaters. And if we consider the manufacture of televisions and sound systems increasingly “cinematic” and economically viable? Will the living room one day be our own private movie theater, with all the comfort and quality of the big screen? The future is anyone's guess, and it's as wonderful as it is frightening, but let's put these digressions aside. Anyone who likes cinema should see this film. It has a good dose of nostalgia, it can move the audience (it moves me) and makes us think about life. It's a little difficult to explain, I think it's one of those films that manages to touch something personal in whoever sees it, and that's not easy to translate onto paper because no two lives are alike. It is also worth going to see the various films that appear on the screens of Paradise, and which are very fair tributes to several well-known films. The cast has very strong names.

The choice of filming locations was careful, all the work with props, costumes and sets was meticulous, and the cinematography is very beautiful.

The crime is largely to confined to pettier crimes, but as aspirations grow so does the scale of the criminality.

Brutal and attention grabbing. Next the cops crack down, bodies pile up and the societal order starts to change. It\'s this young man who grows up into the leading drug-peddling hoodlum amongst a now much more developed township where, tempered only by his more diplomatic childhood friend ""Bené"" (Phellipe Haagensen), the newly named ""Li\'l Zé"" (Leandro Firmino) is ruling the roost. Curiously, his own form of government proves more stable for the residents, and although many are addicts there is a certain degree of law-and-order. Then the runts start to intervene. These are the young children with no hope, no families and only the dream of becoming their own version of ""Li\'l Zé"" one day too. Gradually, the empire expands until it\'s only ""Carrot"" (Matheus Nachtergaele) who stands against him.

It\'s lucky that ""Rocket"" can use a camera. His boss wants publicity to illustrate how dominant and powerful he is. The newspapers want the photographs too. If the young man can walk the tightrope carefully, he might find himself well placed to capitalise on his unique access to a story that by now is gripping their nation. This is a fascinatingly well put together depiction of the worst of human nature; a dog eat dog world, where traditional humanity is scarce and the virtues of a not so benign dictatorship are exposed for all to see. The characterisations are mostly brutal and exploitative, yet there is a place for love and loyalty too amidst a poverty stricken population that craves basics like food and running water and is oblivious to death in the streets. The story is well supplemented by some engaging supporting characters like ""Steak n\' Fries"", ""Goose"", ""Shaggy"" and ""Thiago"" (Daniel Zettel or is it really Timothée Chalamet?). The writing delivers powerfully but sparingly. We don\'t have loads of waffling dialogue, and there\'s also quite a bit of dark humour contained to not so much lighten the mood as to enhance the perception amongst most of the population that kill or be killed was a perfectly reasonable mantra. Firmino, Haagensen and Rodrigues deliver extremely well here in this most impressively photographed and intense look at a society where the top dog was only top by feeding and starving his followers.

Fellowship is indeed merely an opening salvo, and even after three hours in the dark you will likely exit the cinema ravenous with anticipation for the further two parts of the trilogy. Fellowship is also unabashedly rooted in the fantasy genre. Not to be confused with the techno-cool of good science fiction, nor even the cutesy charm of family fare like Harry Potter, the territory of Tolkien is clearly marked by goo and goblins and gobbledegook. Persons with an aversion to lines such as, “To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!” are as well to stay within the Shire-like comforts of home (their loss). With those caveats in place, it bears repeating: fantasy does not come finer. There are electrifying moments — notably the computer-assisted swooping camera through Isengard as it transforms into a factory for evil — when Jackson’s flight of fancy approaches the sublime as the romantic poets would understand it: inspiring awe. Leaving aside the thorny issue of Tolkien die-hards and their inevitable gripes — “What no Tom Bombadil?” — Jackson’s screenplay (written in collaboration with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) is both bolder and more judicious than Steven Kloves’ surprisingly timid retread of Harry Potter. In particular, rescuing the romance of Arwen and Aragorn from the footnotes and the elevation of Saruman to all-action bad guy actually has a corrective influence on Tolkien’s often oblique and female-sparse source material. There are problems, though. The three-hour running time is high on incident and low on discernible form. After successive detours to Elf habitats Rivendell (the watery home of Elrond) and Lothlórien (the forest home of the Lady Galadriel), the uninitiated might well ask why these crazy Elf kids can’t just live together and spare us all this attenuated dramatic structure. More importantly, the action clearly climaxes in the desperate flight from the Mines Of Moria, where the largely seamless SFX is showcased in the best possible light — total darkness — but the narrative demands a different, downbeat ending. Indeed, but for some fine emotional playing from Bean, Mortensen, Astin and Wood, the final fight might feel like a particularly brutal game of paintball in Bluebell Wood. But then, the real battles are yet to come... Verdict - Putting formula blockbusters to shame, Fellowship is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations, and it deserves to play as wide as a certain Mr. Potter. 5/5', 'most_watched_genres': [('Action', 14), ('Adventure', 13), ('Science Fiction', 9), ('Fantasy', 4), ('Other', 3)]}, {'writer': 'gdeveloper', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'An epic movie if I ever saw one.

RELEASED 2001 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring” adapts the first part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The story starts in the homeland of the Hobbits (innocent, diminutive humanoids) where Frodo (Elijah Wood) is instructed by the noble wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to quickly leave the Shire with the powerful One Ring in his possession. Gandalf and Frodo are later accompanied by seven others, the titular ‘Fellowship of the Ring,’ to take the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. The rest of the main cast include Sean Astin (Sam), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sean Bean (Boromir), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) and Hugo Weaving (Elrond). This three-hour fantasy features a diverse cast of colorful characters, quaint beings and settings, moments of genuine wonder, dark ee-vil creatures, high adventure, thrilling brutal action, a superb score, magnificent locations (forests, mountains, rivers, etc.), and wondrous CGI sets. The film LOOKS and SOUNDS so great that it’d be sinful to give it a lower rating. There are problems, however, at least for those who aren’t uber-fans of Tolkien. For one, the opening is hindered by prologue that is overlong and convoluted, not to mention unnecessary. The bulk of it could’ve been conveyed later via flashback, which they do a little bit anyway. Secondly, the story takes forever to build any drive. Thirdly, except for maybe Frodo and Gandalf, the characters are shallow and I didn’t care much what happened to them. Fourthly, main protagonists getting seriously wounded and everyone else expressing their melodramatic concern gets redundant. Fifthly, there are only two females in the main cast (Liv Tyler as Arwen, a half-Elf princess, and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, a royal Elf); unfortunately, their parts aren’t much more than glorified cameos. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $93 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. Despite these negatives, “The Fellowship of the Ring” is the best of the trilogy and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, especially Tolkien fans.

Not five, because some of the changes really bug me, as a long-time Tolkien fan, but a solid four. The casting, to start, was brilliant.  Sean Astin was the absolute perfect choice for Sam, and did a remarkable job bringing that character to life for us.  He really WAS Sam, in this role, in a very deep way.  I always liked his acting, but here, he showed how talented he actually is.  Just amazing.  Elijah Wood gives a great performance of Frodo, and those expressive eyes of his really add a lot of depth to the emotions the character goes through, which are such an important part of the story.  Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan both did great work, for our other two main hobbits.  Their smiles, their singing; just every aspect of these characters was so real.  Viggo Mortensen, of course, was excellent.  He's always good, and though I never would have pictures him as Aragorn, he delivered everything we could hope for.  Great choice for that role!  John Rhys-Davies, as expected, gave us the Gimli we wanted.  Phenomenal actor, and I can't imagine anyone doing that role better.  Orlando Bloom plays a convincing Legolas, and handles the nuances of being an elf quite well.  Sean Bean as Boromir was outstanding, bringing the strength of that character to life, and making us love him.  Then we have Ian McKellen, as Gandalf.  I could never have chosen someone for that role, but the casting folks hit a home run with this one.  Everything about his character was just right.  Literally everything.  I can't read the books without seeing these people in these roles now.  The rest of the cast ws good as well. Then we have the setting.  New Zealand has to have some of the most utterly gorgeous scenery on the planet.  Seeing it in these movies was great, and convincingly Middle Earth, and seeing more since, in other videos, just WOW!  Thanks, to the people of New Zealand, for allowing this to be filmed there! The sets were just fantastic.  Everything looked as good as I'd always hoped it would look, with all the charm, mystery, and wonder  Tolkien fan could hope for.  From Bag end to Rivendell to the vastness of \nMiddle Earth, everything we saw was just right. The only issues I had were some of the changes.  Yes, I know things don't always work in movies as they do in books, but when whole sections are just omitted, that bothers me.  It's not like the movies weren't long already!  That omitted section, with which Tolkien fans will be quite familiar, was a very important part of the plot!  I also didn't care for some of the other changes, and the way Arwen was used, the scene at the river being one example. All in all, though, this was a well done movie, and even though some things bug me, this film, and the rest of the series, will be viewed many times.

I didn’t get too far into the Game of Thrones as the violent rapes got old for me fast. So I watched this first entry of the Lord of the Rings trilogy as just a viewer, not a fan, and I liked it just fine. The complex plot held together well and the scenery was gorgeous. There was violence, but not gore, and for those who don’t like war movies, there wasn’t as much of it here as there is in the other two films of the trilogy. I gather the elfin roles for women were enlarged and brought to the fore, and why not; women were mostly good for setting mead and large pieces of rare meat down on tables in front of their warrior men. I must confess, I found it jarring that the warriors like Strider were so invincible, walking into a horde of sixty orcs and scattering them like toy soldiers with his sword. I know they are epic heroes, but if I’m an orc, I stand back and throw something or whatever, but it is similar to the old legends with semi-gods like Achilles, back when Hector was a pup. I am not going to compare the film to the book — I read it decades ago when I was in high school.

Certainly, it over-hams the accents - maybe just a few too many ""rrrs"" in ""Arrragorrrrn"" but otherwise it\'s a feast for senses. When the hairy-footed Hobbit ""Bilbo"" (Sir Ian Holm) gets to eleventy-one he sets off to write his life-story with the elves.

In addition to having a very strong film industry, Japan is a country with a very rich past that we in the West tend to devalue. A somewhat ethnocentric attitude, more typical of small minds. For a long time, the Japanese were a people divided by several feudal princes who fought among themselves, disputing power and regional influence. It was in this context, moreover, that the first contact between the Japanese and the Portuguese took place, the first Westerners to disembark, demonstrably (Marco Polo speaks of the Japanese, but he probably never went there), on the islands of Japan, where they took the first firearm, the Christian faith and a strong cultural influence: even today, in the Japanese language, there are hundreds of words directly imported from Portuguese. The film that brought me here tells us about one of the most fascinating traditional figures of Japan: the samurai, a warrior similar, in essence, to the European knight. They were educated people who were willing to live off the war, as paid mercenaries. In a land where each feudal lord wages war for himself, with his own troops and against his neighbors, it was not difficult to live off war. It would be difficult to live in peace! The samurai had a code of conduct, the Bushido, which dictated rules according to which they guided their lives, seeking to live and die with honor. Honor was more important than life and therefore, in certain situations, it was expected that the samurai knew how to die and was willing to do so, even if by his own hands, in a suicide ritual. The film begins when a samurai, left unemployed by a long peace, turns to an old man and asks to be allowed to die. In response, he hears a story that occurred some time before, and in which a samurai in the same situation made an identical request in the expectation of receiving money, and ended up having to commit suicide, and with a wooden weapon. The film then reveals an important fact: this first samurai is the father-in-law of the man who killed himself, and who wanted money to feed his sick wife and son. And in fact that warrior is not there in order to simply die, but in order to avenge the son-in-law wronged by human hypocrisy. The film is quite dense, and the fact that it is so different from Western cinema and, even more so, in black and white, can quite scare the current public. However, it is worth resisting this impulse to reject it and giving the film a chance. It's very well done, it has a pretty good story, which is nothing behind big Hollywood hits. The script takes advantage of the situation to expose the brutality of the rigor imposed on the samurai by means of a moral code so absurdly demanding that it ended up being inhumane. Contrary to what happens in some films, even western ones, this film does a good historical contextualization of the story it tells us, not being too difficult to understand what is at stake. I'm not the best person to talk about the director or the actors, I don't know them, but I can say that we have the participation of Tatsuya Nakadai, Yoshiro Aoki and Akira Ishihama.

McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the ""mental illness"" card to get out of prison time, thinking it\'ll be a piece of cake, but he\'s wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy\'s ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface. ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest"" (1975) is a film you\'ll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn\'t \'get\' a lot of the insights the film conveys. The movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their ""therapy"" is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (often at the taxpayer\'s expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be ""dealt with."" A lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched ""isn\'t that bad"" or that ""she was only trying to do her job"", etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film\'s brilliance: Ratched\'s malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she\'s authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman. The filmmakers and Fletcher (not to mention the author of the book, Ken Kesey) make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare her to, say, Faye Dunaway\'s portrayal of Joan Crawford in ""Mommie Dearest,"" which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn\'t such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif). McMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he\'s impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others. Nurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That\'s because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (rule). The problem with this is that ""appearances"" are not about inward reality and, worse, ""the letter kills."" Despite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a lifetime. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, but only those who deserve it – the humble – not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you\'ll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren\'t any good people in such institutions, of course).

One Flew Over The Cuckoo\'s Nestclean swept the Oscars in 1976, taking home the five biggest prizes as only the second film to do so since It Happened One Night. In reality, it is an extremely frustrating film. Pitched as a ""man against the system"", McMurphy is clearly written to be chaotic and bring some colour to the otherwise black and white world of the hospital. Meanwhile, Ratched is the oppressive villain sticking regimentally to routine despite the suffering of the patients. In actuality, the opposite appears true. While McMurphy is disruptive, he often comes across as a bully, coercing the patients against their will. Even as he gains some of their trust, he continues to manipulate until he has a majority behind him. Ratched on the other hand is the voice of reason. While the medical practices are undeniably oppressive by modern standards, she remains cool, calm and collected at all times when dealing with her patients. That being said, Nicholson does give a career defining performance, fully deserving of his Academy Award. It is often his body language or subtle facial expressions that betray the mischief of McMurphy, and these human qualities cannot be expressed in a script. He switches from the chaos and disorder of a profanity-ridden baseball commentary to the benign friendship of some of his fellow interns with consummate professionalism. He leads an all-star cast including both Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd, but the other standout is debutant Brad Dourif as the stuttering and immature Billy Bibbit. And, whenever the film veers towards bedlam, it is Louise Fletcher - who reportedly took on the role while other bigger names in Hollywood declined it for fear of being cast as the villain - who brings it back to earth with strong and capable acting. Overall, a mixed bag. Fortunately, the weak characters are more than carried by the superb story and acting.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 13), ('Romance', 5), ('Comedy', 5), ('History', 4), ('Other', 14)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '80%', 'review': '“McMurphy” (Jack Nicholson) is a veteran with an attitude who has pled insanity to escape his latest court appearance on a charge of statutory rape.

His smart-assed confidence endears him to some of his fellow inmates, especially the impressionable “Billy” (Brad Dourif) but also earns him the instant enmity of the chief nurse “Ratched” (Louise Fletcher) who is used to ruling with a psychological rod of iron augmented by pils, pills and more pills. Initially, “Mac” is simply concerned with his own predicament, but as he witnesses the regime that treats these people with indifference, disdain and little affection, he starts to become a little more invested in their future’s. When he manages to orchestrate a wheeze to get the men out on the water for some fishing, then the battle lines are truly drawn - but who is going to emerge victorious? Nicholson is great here as his character evolves before our eyes from a cocky and arrogant one but it is Fletcher who really steals the show and that’s with remarkably little dialogue just a powerful degree of sheer on-screen malevolence. Ken Kesey’s original novel shines quite a potent light on the frankly quite brutal treatment of patients with mental illnesses, even when some of these individuals are volunteers who think this treatment might actually lead to some sort of “cure”; and also at the attitudes of the State that is all to frequently out of sight, out of mind. Milos Forman has paced this tautly and there’s plenty of double-edged humour as a war of words becomes much more one of attrition.

There are certain films that impress us so much when we see them that we are really surprised when we discover how ignored they were by the great awards. This film is one of them: I was really shocked to find that it wasn\'t even nominated for an Oscar or a Golden Globe… and I had to read a bit to understand why that happened. The film is perhaps one of the best in Sérgio Leone\'s extensive filmography, and is often compared to other great gangster films such as ""Godfather"". I, personally, wouldn\'t dare to do that, but I could still put this film in the “top ten” of the great mobster films. Amazingly, it was a huge box office failure in the US because they insisted on releasing there an extremely cut version, with about two and a half hours. A version so forgettable and badly edited that no one understood the story and that the film had no chance of running for the highest awards in the industry! It was a shot in the foot and proves the importance of a good edition for the quality of the product. Sometimes a longer film is preferable to a sterile, abridged version. The script is wonderful and follows the criminal path of a small group of youngsters from a Jewish community in New York, stretching from the 20s to the 60s. The story revolves around Noodles, but the main character ends up being Max, who becomes the gang\'s boss. The relationship between them is very well explored. However, not everything went well: there is a love sub-plot between Noodles and Deborah that is never taken further, there are several characters that seem too sketchy and underdeveloped and there are situations that the film doesn\'t know how to explore as it should (the most glaring being the violent death of the youngest gang member). I just can\'t say how many of these problems started in the editing room, with radical cuts in the story told. Robert DeNiro was one of the first names to be hired for the cast, and had a say in the choice of several other actors. DeNiro is impeccable, and he provides us with excellent quality work. Moreover, I think that this helped to glue the actor\'s image a little to the criminal films in the popular imagination, along with “Taxi Driver” and “Goodfellas”. James Woods is also amazing in the role he has been given and leaves with this film his greatest film work. Elizabeth McGovern also does very well here, although I feel that the actress was not able to make her career take off afterward (I only saw her really successful now, with “Downton Abbey”). I also liked the brief, but remarkable, participation of Jennifer Connelly, still very young. And I feel sorry for Joe Pesci, because the actor is wasted by appearing only in a couple of scenes (perhaps another victim of the radical cuts in the editing room). Leone uses everything he knows in this film and provides us with incredible, beautiful cinematography, which knows how to take advantage of slow camera movements, close-ups in the most striking scenes and intense colors. The flashbacks are quite well-marked, and anyone familiar with the cinematic resource will have no difficulty in following the temporal advances and retreats that take place. The special effects do their job well, the costumes are excellent, and the characterization has its moments (DeNiro has been masterfully aged, and very much resembles what he is today). As a film where crime and violence are things we expect to find, we have an array of violent scenes and graphic situations that include not only brutal murders, beatings and shootings but also teen sex, voyeurism and, most notably, a long and particularly graphic rape scene. It\'s not a movie for the faint-hearted. A final word for the soundtrack, by Ennio Morricone. It is highly regarded by connoisseurs and I admit it works, but I\'m not a fan of the pan pipe. I feel it gives the film an oriental touch, it would be something I would expect more from a martial arts film soundtrack.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'Told by way of a really potent (and well scored by Morricone) retrospective, this sits us down and takes us through a forty year period in the life of the now down-at-heel ""Noodles"" (Robert De Niro) and of the development of the city of New York. The contents of an old briefcase serve as an aide memoire as the retrospective illustrates just how he and three of his childhood friends decided that the gutter was not for them, and that using the ""system"" to get on was the only way. Prohibition, violence, crime, brutality were the currency back then and ""Noodles"" learned not to have scruples about such things. Love, romance feature too - choices, compromises and tragedy all feature as Sergio Leone and De Niro immerses us in the characterful and emotionally charged chronology. The film looks great, the attention to detail is superb, and a really strong supporting cast help offer us s sense that we are actually there for much of the time. Living and breathing the squalor, the danger, the opportunity and perhaps, the inevitability, of the paths these kids took in a the 1930s. It is very long, but that\'s effective rather than dull. It allows the characters to develop, to breathe and then to disappear - only, perhaps, to reappear in a different guise later on. Ageing is also a factor here too - just as they rose, others rise too with differing standards and ethics - their sense of loyalty and integrity not quite marrying up! No Oscar nominations which is really rather odd - this is easily one of the best, most authentic-looking, depictions of the rise of NYC that cinema has ever delivered.

As a stand-alone film, however, The Two Towers is not quite as good as Fellowship. (Nor, indeed, does it extend the universe or deepen the relationships in the manner of The Empire Strikes Back.) That it still merits the full five stars is merely an indication of how high the benchmark has been set. Picking up pretty much where Fellowship left off, this is a considerably darker film, with Frodo (Wood) falling further under the influence of the Ring (giving rise to some seriously spooky hallucinations), while Saruman (Christopher Lee) wreaks even more havoc. There\'s also the first appearance of Saruman\'s spy, the sinister Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and the complex Gollum, a brilliant combination of computer trickery and raspy vocals from Andy Serkis (the campaign for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar starts here). Other newcomers include Faramir (David Wenham), the understandably miffed brother of the recently deceased Boromir, and Éowyn (Miranda Otto), who spends much of her time casting winsome glances in the general direction of Aragorn (Mortensen). Eventually the plot complexities become more coherent, setting the action up for the forthcoming finale, The Return Of The King. As we\'ve come to expect, this is spectacular stuff - from an opening which sees Frodo troubled by dreams about the demise of Gandalf, through to the climactic Battle Of Helm\'s Deep, which is nothing short of breathtaking. But Jackson cleverly tempers the louder, brasher sequences with some heartstring-tugging moments - peasants despondent as they are forced to abandon their villages, Aragorn and Arwen\'s troubled relationship, and, of course, the return of Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen, superb as ever), one of the film\'s most powerful, memorable images that may well leave Ring devotees a little misty-eyed. However, those who still believe that the trilogy is beyond criticism may find their views challenged by The Two Towers. It\'s just as long as the first film, but gets the heroes no closer to a final victory. And, where the first movie developed its emotional tone from the brightness of The Shire to a darker climax, the sequel is more of a one-note affair, shadowy in both look and content. This is particularly true of the Ringbearer\'s quest, which adds the not-insignifcant Gollum to the party, but suffers more than the other story strands from the cross-cutting and finishes with a nearly identical pep talk from Sam to the tearful speech that climaxed Fellowship. Of course, given the nature of the material, and Jackson\'s desire to be faithful, this is all understandable. And by the time we all end up under siege at Helm\'s Deep, it\'s unlikely anyone will give a toss about narrative arcs: like Gollum, this is simply gob-smacking, mind-blowing, never-seen-before stuff. Verdict - It may lack the first-view-thrill and natural dramatic shape of Fellowship, but this is both funnier and darker than the first film, and certainly more action-packed. An essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time. 5/5', 'most_watched_genres': [('Action', 14), ('Adventure', 13), ('Science Fiction', 9), ('Fantasy', 4), ('Other', 3)]}, {'writer': 'Wuchak', 'score': '60%', 'review': ""That Damned Ring. RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers” adapts the second part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The surviving ‘Fellowship’ of the first film has been divided into three small groups for this one: The Hobbits Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) team-up with the mad Gollum (Andy Serkis) to make their way to Mordor, but are captured by Faramir (David Wenham), the brother of the deceased Boromir. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) encounter the once-great King Theoden (Bernard Hill), who has fallen under the spell of Saruman (Christopher Lee) via his devious minion Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). Meanwhile the Hobbits Pippin and Merry (Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan) try to enlist the help of huge tree creatures. Gandalf is also on hand (Ian McKellen). These story threads culminate in the great Battle at Helms Deep in the third hour. This three-hour fantasy/adventure starts out more engaging than the first film, which was laden by its overlong, convoluted and (for the most part) unnecessary prologue. Like that movie, the characters are colorful, the tale is imaginative, there’s a lot of brutal action rounded out by quieter moments and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS great. Unfortunately, after the first act, Jackson opts for CGI porn (excessive use of CGI with the corresponding dizzying visual effects). The first film did this too, but this one ups the ante and so there’s not as much spectacular New Zealand cinematography (i.e. real forests, mountains, rivers, etc.). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you’ll likely appreciate this installment more than me. There are other problems: While the characters are imaginative, they’re also shallow and rather dull, at least for mature people who require more depth to maintain their interest. Also, the wide-spanning (meandering) story with numerous characters and hard-to-remember names tends to be disengaging. I was never much captivated by the characters and their causes, although uber-fans of Tolkien might be. Another problem is the lack of prominent female protagonists. We have Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden's niece, who falls in love with the noble Aragorn and that’s about it, except for cameos by Liv Tyler as Arwen and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. Despite these negatives, “The Two Towers” was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados who liked the first movie. THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 59 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.

I like the end-credits when it started in the Animated Tv Show Spider-Man (1966) when the two Spider-Men look exactly like each other arguing, but this time, it was Spider-Man pointing to Spider-Man 2099. How did they do that?

But Luke gets a calling to the planet Dagobah, where under the tutelage of Jedi Master, Yoda, he hopes to become a Jedi himself, but that also brings him closer to his, and Leia's, destiny. Lets tell it as it is, The Empire Strikes Back is a better film than Star Wars, not as impacting of course, but most definitely better. Technically, in story telling and in tone, it holds up well today and certainly warrants the amount of times it crops up in best sequels debates. That it's not actually a sequel is irrelevant, it is of course the filler in a wonderful sci-fi sandwich, because as second instalments go, Empire has few peers. With Empire Strikes Back we get all the whizz bang adventure strewn heart of Star Wars, but George Lucas (stepping aside for Irvin Kershner to direct) has also fleshed the story out with a serious dark tone that oddly becomes a bedfellow to the romantic fun on offer, where new and engaging characters (and creatures) add spice to this wonderful fantastical broth. Aided by the considerable writing talent of Leigh Brackett (The Long Goodbye, Rio Bravo, The Big Sleep), Lucas took the bold and ingenious step of giving the bad guys the upper hand, in fact it could be argued that he was taking a considerable risk with his ending. Forcing his viewers to wait for the final chapter (three years later), after tantalisingly setting us up with a corker of plot twist (one which is still to this day as potent as it was back on release), Lucas pulled perhaps one of the cheekiest carrot dangles in cinema history. Though more famed for its dark undertones, Empire is for sure still a very fun movie, C3PO goes into camp overdrive and Han Solo ups his quip quota by some margin. Then of course there is Yoda, in himself a comedic joy. The action sequences beg for repeat viewings, a battle on the ice laden planet Hoth is a marvel and the choreography for Skywalker's fight with Darth Vader is out of the top draw.

This man offers them a template to teach themselves; to solve problems and develop teamwork skills and to realise that their options are not quite as limited as might have seemed when they started compulsory schooling with precious little interest in any of it. It also asks questions about the rigid nature of repetitive learning and invites us to consider what is or isn\'t a teacher\'s place in a community that is historically constrained by perceptions of realism.

This is the next best anime in the recent time after 'Your Name'. Not that you know this director very well, not at the international level. But with a film like this, she's going to be. This is another teen romance. Well, romance is not exactly a word that matches with what this film is about narrative, but there's no other way to describe its theme. It was like before romance, that mean before committing to a relationship and after you had started to like someone while fixing the mistakes made in the past. It's a high school tale. Before that, it opened with a brief flashback of the elementary school events, where Shoya Ishida bullied a new admission Shoko Nishimiya for her hearing impairment. Soon after that, she'd transferred to another school. Now, a few years later, they meet again in the high school, where Ishida tried to fix what he had done wrong a while ago for her. So a relationship develops, despite people around them does not understand their commitment. At some point, it will be tested, which might lead to uncover their true feeling to one another. This is surely aimed at the teen audience. Especially, the romance and sentimental parts are intended for the youngsters, but anyone would enjoy it. So, I felt them, but not like I'm still young. Otherwise, I would have said it is a masterpiece. That's only from the story perspective. The sketches and animations were not bad. The film characters were awesome. Each one was very unique and different people pick different characters as their favourite. I liked Yuzuru as I always like tomboyish type roles. But obviously Ishida and Shoko make this film. ❝Please don't make such a serious face. And, let me say... I am sorry.❞ Smooth animation. Technically comparable with any big names (anime titles). That also means the director is now in the league of the best anime-maker. She's young and I hope she keeps doing more films. As I said many times before, that after Hayao Miyazaki retired from making films, we need more people like this filmmaker to fill that empty space. The film won many awards for its great achievement, as well as box office success in the domestic market. Expecting the rest of the world and anime fans to receive it at the same extent. It was originally based on the manga of the same name, and a television series was made before this feature anime. As I collect film quotes, the best ones, I was disappointed on that context. There were many emotionally and romantically appealing lines, but not on the moral perception. That does not mean the film lacks the social consciousness. In fact, the film highlights the bullying and its severe consequences. That alone is enough, this is a must see for the school kids. Surely kids, teens and some youngsters would love it, but as far as the adults, this is not an ideal thematic, yet you can't ignore its artistry and the intention of the film. Sometimes it might help you to like it in the second viewing. Because this is one of those kind. My issue was understanding the Japanese sign language. Besides, the subtitle for that was not much helpful, as it was exactly translated as what the hearing impaired character babbled which is an alternate spelling for every word and sentence. I had lots of fun watching it, as well as other moods like romantic, touching, annoyance, but overall it leans towards the good side. Just over two hours, it never looked too slow or hurried in the story or the character developments. Could be the best to pick as a date flick or get together with your school friends, particularly opposite sex friends.

Simmons). As his wish starts becoming a reality, he realises the brutality of this teacher who continually pushes him with questionable methods. Damien Chazelle's direction is almost of a tense boxing or war action drama in that it constantly uses the music of the drumming to build the tension whilst using violent and sharp editing whilst the jazz band play. Chazelle's screenplay is very well written. It is filled with humour, tension and heartbreak. The way in which Fletcher switches during Andrew's first lesson is expertly done. Fletcher relentlessly insults Andrew in a very shocking way which really creates a huge sense of sympathy for Andrew's character as he struggles to respond. The insulting dialogue is very similar to Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' in that it is both humourous and disturbingly distressing. The performances in this film are remarkable. Miles Teller is a relative newcomer but takes to this character with so much depth and understanding. The drumming scenes look like incredible and torturous workouts and Teller really shows the pain and agony his character is going through to reach his dream. The chemistry between the two central characters is flawless. J.K. Simmons is perfect as the abusive music teacher. Simmons manages to combine Fletcher's distinguished persona with his terrifying unpredictability. Simmons reminds me of his character in Valve's 'Portal 2' in which he continuously spouts insults at the player in a darkly hilarious way.

Terence Fletcher, an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man\'s life. OK let me just start off with this. You had no idea how much I was really looking forward to Whiplash. This was on my movies to check out list, because I heard nothing but positive things from this movie and I heard a lot of people described this film has the ""Full Metal Jacket"" but with no war or guns, but with music and well... drums. I think Whiplash and ""Birdman"" was the two movies I wanted to see before making my best movies of the year list, because who knows they might make the list. I haven\'t seen ""Birdman"" yet but will do soon, but I finally had the chance to see Whiplash and my god this movie was just so spectacularly flawless in many ways. Whiplash is the best move of 2014. J.K. Simmons in this movie probably pulls of the best performance in his career. Every word that came out of his mouth didn\'t feel like he was reading from the script then act it out. I felt every angry punch of words that came out of him, because it was so real. I didn\'t see J.K. Simmons just playing a movie character in this movie, no he was the freaking Fletcher. Now let\'s talk about Terence Fletcher: The best way to describe Fletcher to those who haven\'t seen the film yet, well his like Sgt. Hartman from ""Full Metal Jacket"". When he\'s on screen your locked on and he\'s also the kind of person that would be somebody\'s worse nightmare to have for a boss. This guy doesn\'t just like music, he breaths music and he wants his band to do perfect. His opinion and his look on music is another thing why I didn\'t flat out just hated him, I actually understood him. He made a very good point about how people will comment on you act and say ""You did a good job"", and yes I did use the words ""you did a great job"", in my past reviews but now I\'m never going to use it ever again after this movie. Miles Teller was another stand out performances in this movie, and just like ""Foxcatacher"" where Channing Tatum was so over looked by his performance, well Miles Teller has proved himself to be more then a teen in a movie that will be forgotten and so would he, but no Miles Teller played this character so brilliantly he could become the next big thing. Now his character in this movie has the love of the true art of music and you can see that he wants to tell people his love for music, but when the harsh life of reality comes crashing into him it\'s truly heartbreaking to see his struggle and effort just not being good enough. Teller played this character so realistic and so brilliantly flawless. The directing and the writing in this was just....perfect. Damien Chazelle gave this movie style and passion to tell a story about two strong music buffs battling out and he freaking nailed it. This movie also had probably the best finale that I\'ve seen in years. My nails were digging into the seat. I didn\'t dare to look away not for one moment, not for one second. I was simply locked on and when it was over... I\'m kidding you I actually clapped towards the end of this movie. Now the biggest cliche that I always hear from critics when their talk about a different movies and their use words like ""You will clap at the end"", but you don\'t, or ""You will feel inspired after the film"", and I you don\'t. But Whiplash actually did make me feel inspirited towards the end and made me clap. It\'s message of not giving up and the dream that you been chancing for isn\'t just going to come to you. Movies like Pride, freedom Writers and all that such never ever give me that inspiring feeling inside of me, until I watched this movie. Overall rating: Whiplash is a movie that everybody needs to see. This isn\'t just a popcorn movie where you come and put you legs up and laugh a couple of times, no this movie reaches out to people out there that have the same problems that these character\'s have, with their passion of what their what to do in life get\'s over shadowed by something you don\'t want to do and this movie get\'s it right.

This killer is not only unstoppable in perpetrating his violent crimes, he is, as Freeman\'s weary retirement bound Detective Somerset says, methodical and patient. It\'s going to end bad, the cops know it and so do we, and that\'s when Fincher and Walker stick their hands into our guts and pull out the last semblance of solids to deliver one of the greatest endings of modern cinema. An ending fit to grace any noir, neo-noir or smart ass psychological horror movie from across the ages. With each viewing of Seven there\'s the repeating wave of bleak emotions that come as the reversed end credits roll, desolation and disbelief, sadness and shock, our trip through earthly hell is over, but only in the psychical sense! Faultless cast performances, no doubt eked out by what we now know is a task-master director, photography that brilliantly brings to ""light"" the melancholic sheen of a decaying society and a Howard Shore score that crawls out of the speakers and cloaks your body like some evil Incubus or Succubus. Seven, a masterpiece of unease and evil wrung out by a master director. 10/10', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 43), ('Thriller', 42), ('Crime', 34), ('Action', 29), ('Other', 111)]}, {'writer': 'Repo Jack', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'Se7en put David Fincher on the map with this uber-creepy mystery thriller.

I don\'t believe in having a definite Top10 or Top20 of every film I\'ve ever seen. However, if I had to write this special list, I have no doubts that Se7en would be there. Obviously, this is a rewatch of the classic movie that impacted filmmaking and launched David Fincher\'s remarkable career (I also ignore the fact that Alien 3 is connected to Fincher due to the known production issues). With his next film, Mank, coming up on Netflix in a few weeks, I decided to go through part of his filmography. Se7en will be the first out of five Fincher\'s movies that I will be able to revisit throughout this week. I\'ve seen this film countless times, but to be completely honest, I haven\'t seen it in so long that I didn\'t remember exactly some important plot points and a key component about the ending. This helped me experience Se7en in a fascinating way once again. Andrew Kevin Walker\'s screenplay has one of the most intriguing, mysterious, captivating narratives I\'ve ever witnessed, still to this day. From the very beginning to the last second, I\'m constantly at the edge of my seat (in this case, my couch) with severe anxiety levels and feeling incredibly tense. Biting my nails, moving my leg up and down, changing positions… it\'s so mesmerizing that I\'m only writing about it more than twenty-four hours after I watched it. One of the most impressive aspects is how Fincher is able to leave the viewer uncomfortable with showing only a single death on-screen. This is an extremely dark, gory, blood-soaked, gruesome flick, packed with horrible displays of dead bodies, but never the actual murder scene. With just a simple photo or a straight line of dialogue, Fincher lets the viewer\'s imagination do the work, and it\'s undoubtedly as or more effective than a visually horrific killing sequence. As the premise implies, the serial killer is inspired by the ""seven deadly sins"", and he goes after the respective sinners, killing them (or letting them kill themselves) in an innovative fashion, turning the sin against the sinner. The gluttony and sloth cases are visually brutal, but the lust murder is the one that keeps haunting my memory. The latter is also the less explicit, left to open-minded people to imagine the despicable act. In 1995, a movie with such a dismal environment and dark story couldn\'t be well-received, and Se7en got its fair share of negative reviews stating that it was too obscure, sinister, overly violent and that the ending was absolutely unacceptable. Over time, it found its success, it gained fans all around the world, and it\'s now considered by many as one of the greatest films ever made, myself included. From the outstanding cast to the astonishingly enthralling detective work, the third act stands out as one of the most shocking endings of all-time. I\'m keeping this review spoiler-free because I don\'t want readers who have not seen this movie to have such a magnificent piece of cinema ruined for them. That\'s why I\'m also hiding a certain actor from the starring section, just like the marketing team did at the original date of release (I\'ll get there). Fincher\'s third act is simply flawless. Everything displayed on-screen in the last twenty minutes is filmmaking perfection. From the impressively suspenseful build-up to that jaw-dropping climactic moment, passing through a mind-blowing revelation, Se7en\'s conclusion is and will remain as one of the most brutally shocking endings in the history of cinema. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt share fantastic chemistry, portraying two iconic characters that couldn\'t be more different than one another. Somerset is a notable detective with extreme attention to detail, knowledgeable, and always curious about the case at hand. Freeman incorporates this character effortlessly, delivering a subtle yet powerful performance. Pitt portrays Mills, a childish, unfocused, immature replacement to the previous detective about to retire. Despite its apparent lack of work ethics, Mills is clever, relentless in finding the killer, and desperately wants to prove himself. Pitt, just like Freeman, embodies this persona seamlessly and also gives an outstanding interpretation. Technically, where should I begin? From the haunting score of Howard Shore to the documentary-like cinematography (Darius Khondji) that offers a tremendously realistic atmosphere, it\'s the phenomenal production design that stands out. Fincher really wanted the dirty, rainy, depressing city to feel authentic and as real as possible. The first dialogues of the film are meant to point out the bleakness and awfulness of the city, but even without these conversations, any viewer will be able to acknowledge the absence of color, joyfulness, and life in this unknown location. Fincher\'s filmmaking techniques are demonstrated in plain splendor for everyone to see, and this was just his beginning. Movies like Se7en are impossible to be made today, period. It would never be conceivable to completely hide one of the main actors from the press tour and/or trailers. We live in a time where the promotion of a film must have everything and everyone. Nowadays, trailers show way too much, and this isn\'t news to anyone. The ending was forced by Pitt and Fincher since the studio wanted a more mainstream conclusion. Today, filmmakers may have more freedom, but there are still countless cases of executive producers changing a movie without the director\'s will and/or permission. Se7en was a film released in a time where it should have never been released in the first place. Fortunately, it was. Se7en might be the best director\'s sophomore movie in the history of cinema, and it\'s undoubtedly one of my favorite films of all-time. David Fincher\'s classic possesses one of the most captivating screenplays I\'ve ever witnessed, marked by an extremely dark, somber, violent, gruesome story that ends with one of the most emotionally shocking conclusions to a movie, ever. The lack of on-screen death scenes is both the most surprising and effectively powerful element of the whole film, leaving the unpleasant work of imagining a specific type of murder to the viewer\'s mind. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are extraordinary as the now iconic detectives, delivering two truly brilliant performances. Fincher\'s trademark filmmaking style started here, as every technical aspect contributes to the movie\'s incredible realism. From the simple, documentary-like camera work to the ominous score, it\'s the authentic production design that sets the depressing tone, the bleak atmosphere, and the rainy, colorless, lifeless city. Overall, it\'s a technically flawless piece of art. One of the greatest films ever made…. I can\'t recommend it more.

The film is based on the idea of lucid dreams. In the story, the professionals of industrial espionage, using special techniques to steal valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during sleep, when the human mind is most vulnerable, learn a new technique - the ‘inception’ of ideas into the human mind through his dream.

In particular, he wonders whether his neighbor Thorvald (Raymond Burr, who actually looks older than his later character Perry Mason) may have killed his wife. Hitchcock examines the situation from numerous points of view.  At one extreme, Jeff could be considered a brilliant detective who sleuths out a case based purely on close observation.  At the other end, he could be considered a voyeur and a paranoid whose suspicions could damage other people.  These interpretations are voiced by his acquaintances, including his nurse (Thelma Ritter) and his fiance  (Grace Kelly, the future Princess Grace of Monaco).

Much like most of Alfred Hitchcock's other lauded pictures, Rear Window has been dissected, examined, appraised and written about by far more versed people than myself, a mere film fanatic.

The film of course forces us the viewers to become voyeurs, watching a newly hooked voyeur go about his business. Quite a neat trick from Hitchcock, and one can reasonably assume that the maestro director was chuckling with glee within his genius girth. Working from the confines of a single set, Hitchcock has molded a suspenseful, intriguing, cheeky and sexy picture, with a top line cast giving the smart screenplay the performances it deserved. What is often forgot by those more concerned with the psychological aspects of Rear Window is the blatant irony of L.B. Jefferies situation, his obsession with the neighbours is not confined to a probable case of murder, his interest first and foremost is with the love lives of those he observes, thus forcing (excusing) him to acknowledge the love from the woman who so wants to be in his life! It's also important to note the merits of each character of the piece, those that visit Jefferies and the conversations that take place, even the suspected murderer has a bemused interest pouring from his very frame.

So, for me,The Silence of the Lambsis a childhood favorite. Some would say I had an unusual childhood, in this age where some people actuallyavoidR-rated movies like the plague. The fact that I sawSomething Wild, which Jonathan Demme directed five years beforeThe Silence of the Lambs, as well as the originalAlien(alone at that), at the same age probably indicates that they were okay with me watching pretty much anything that wasn\'t rated X, though, honestly, I\'veneverhad any interest in that stuff. It was probably due to the fact that, like the movie\'s protagonist, I don\'t ""spook easily,"" and many so-called ""scary"" movies, including this one, never scared me, but (many of them) definitely thrilled me. Granted, I\'d seenSaving Private Ryana few months before, which probably gave me a strong stomach. Well, enough about my wild, albeit fun, childhood. How doesThe Silence of the Lambshold up all these years later? For me personally,The Silence of the Lambsis every bit as good as it was the first time I saw it at five years old. On the off chance you don\'t already know the plot by now, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a rookie FBI agent with a degree in psychology who is called from training by her boss Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) in the middle of a string of murders by a man nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine) who skins his victims, all of whom happen to be women. Crawford tells her to interview the psychotic Dr. Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in prison, hoping he might have an answer of some kind. Lecter brushes her off. After Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of a senator is kidnapped, Lecter agrees to give Starling information about Buffalo Bill on the condition that she tell him personal information about herself. If I had to pick the greatest Best Picture Oscar winner ever, it would most likely beThe Silence of the Lambs. Well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, it\'s definitely my favorite. Let\'s look at the acting to start. Jodie Foster, unsurprisingly, won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance as Starling. Foster plays Starling as a little scared yet strong at the same time, definitely not a coward as Julianne Moore later played the character in the movieHannibal, and definitely not someone who would turn cannibal as Thomas Harris wrote the character as doing in the novel Hannibal. Movie or novel, in my honest opinion, the Clarice Starling depicted inHannibalis an insult to what this Clarice Starling stands for. As we find out about what\'s been nagging Starling since childhood, Foster plays it especially well where another actress may have overdone it.\nAnthony Hopkins, like Foster, won an Oscar for his performance as Lecter, and I speak for a lot of people, if not everybody, when I say it was also well-deserved. Hopkins plays Lecter as brilliant yet insane, making him one of the more interesting villains in movie history.\nScott Glenn plays Crawford very well for the time he\'s onscreen.\nTed Levine plays ""Buffalo Bill"" as straight up crazy, and does a very good job of making us hate him.\nBrooke Smith is only supposed to play Catherine Martin as scared and she does - with dead-on accuracy. Ted Tally won a well-deserved Oscar for his screenplay, adapted from Thomas Harris\' novel of the same name. Tally doesn\'t feel the need to focus on violence and gore, which is one of the movie\'s strengths. Instead he focuses on the characters, and I\'d be lying if I said he didn\'t flesh them out very, very, very, well. Jonathan Demme also won an Oscar for his directing and he does a very good job of it. The Silence of the Lambsis relentlessly thrilling and it holds me to my seat until the last frame every time I see it, all without relying on excessive gore.\nI\'ve already mentioned thatThe Silence of the Lambsdoesn\'t scare me, so it may - or may not - scare you, depending on what you\'re afraid of. Admittedly, there are a few creepy things displayed onscreen so I can see why it would scare some viewers.\nEither way, I can\'t recommendThe Silence of the Lambsenough, and everybody should see it at least once. The Silence of the Lambsis a childhood favorite of mine, and it holds up very, very well almost 25 years after its release. It\'s relentlessly thrilling, flawlessly acted, flawlessly written, flawlessly directed, and one of the few movies that actually deserved all the Oscars it won.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Animation', 48), ('Drama', 40), ('Adventure', 37), ('Action', 33), ('Other', 157)]}, {'writer': 'Gimly', 'score': '80%', 'review': ""This is one of a few movies I put off reviewing for years, because I honestly don't know what to say about a film this classic.

It’s dark, intense, and layered with meaning, making it the kind of film that sticks with you long after the credits roll. This isn’t a casual weekend watch but rather a cinematic experience that deserves full attention. Jonathan Demme’s directing is sharp and precise, keeping the story tight without any wasted moments. Every scene feels deliberate, building suspense in a way that’s subtle yet incredibly effective. The cinematography plays a huge role in this, with its use of close-ups making the film feel personal and claustrophobic. There’s an intimacy to the way characters are shot, pulling you into their headspace and making the psychological tension hit even harder. The acting is what really elevates the movie to legendary status. Jodie Foster delivers an incredible performance, bringing both vulnerability and determination to her role. But it’s Anthony Hopkins who steals the show, creating one of the most chilling yet mesmerizing characters in film history. His screen presence is magnetic, proving that sometimes, the scariest thing isn’t loud or violent but calm, calculated, and intelligent. The script is airtight, filled with sharp dialogue that never feels forced. Every exchange has weight, and the conversations alone are enough to keep you on edge. The score and sound design play a crucial role in building atmosphere. The music is haunting yet subtle, never overdoing it but always enhancing the unease. Silence is used just as effectively as sound, making certain moments feel even more intense.

They really missed an opportunity for if not a great pop culture reference, but at least an in-joke for the punk community.  I mean, throw us a bone here.  He spent half his time mocking us anyway (in a pretty hysterical way) at least give us the laugh when they do the face reveal. Anyway, it\'s not bad.  Miles is less... boring in this cartoon than he is in the comics where he\'s developed the moniker ""Mild Morales.""  He actually has more depth of character here and is forced to face some serious choices and turning points (Hey Marvel, you could learn a lesson here). But he also took a bit of a back seat to Stacey, who seemed to be the star of the show until there was an abrupt switch... which irritated me.  It sort of screamed ensemble cast, but really it just shifter from one lead to the other a bit abruptly.  As far as complaints go, that\'s pretty bare bones. It also gave Spidey 2099 a sort of bad spin despite being the most beloved of the 2099 line and the coolest costume design of any spider.  So for us Gen-Xers, it sort of burned.  At least I\'m old enough to have been looking forward to his inclusion only to be a little disappointed.

It’s the type of achievement in animation that’s not only artistically skilled but also wildly entertaining. This is one of the most perfect pieces of animated cinema in years and even better, it’s aimed squarely at more sophisticated audiences of older kids, teens, and adults. Miles Morales (voice of Shameik Moore) is back for part two, and he’s happily fulfilling his duties as Brooklyn’s friendly neighborhood superhero. Miles finds himself joining forces with Gwen Stacy (voice of Hailee Steinfeld) and a new team of elite Spider heroes (featuring the voices of Jake Johnson, Karan Soni, Issa Rae, and others) from across the multiverse as they work together to fight off a powerful villain. The plot is complex, but the story is terrific. The parallel universes at play don’t feel like a gimmick, and there are real stakes for every character. There are strong messages about teamwork, friendship, power, and responsibility, and it’s nice to see more female representation in a film that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. The story is a little slow at the start, but things pick up ones Miles enters the picture. His relationship with Gwen is developed extensively here, and they’re a great onscreen duo. The film is computer-animated, and the visuals are nothing short of masterful. The animation is vibrant, skillfully executed, and absolutely stunning. This is the type of visual art that leaves your eyes begging for more. From the attention to detail to the choice of hues, there isn’t one misstep to be found. The story, however, has a few stumbles, and most of that stems from the overly long run time (2 hours, 20 minutes), the too-insider Easter egg references for diehard comic fans, and the irritating cliffhanger ending that is so obnoxious that it almost ruins everything that came before. Thank goodness the rest of the movie is so much fun. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” is the type of film that proves animation isn’t just for kids, and it’s certainly not a throwaway medium that deserves to be dismissed. It’s an action-packed, visually dazzling, frentic, and outrageously fun piece of cinema. Go see it.

Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) is finding it even harder to hide his secret from his family who has grown concerned that his erratic behavior is more than the usual teenage angst. In another earth, Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) deals with her Police officer father desperately hunting down her alter-ego believing that she is a killer which drives a wedge between them as Gwen desperately tries to find her way forward. In “Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse audiences learn that what one perceives as reality is often just the corner of a much larger picture and when Miles confronts what he dismisses as a “Villain of the Week” in a quirky enemy known as The Spot (Jason Schwartzman), starts a campaign against Spider-Man, he soon finds that the threat is much larger than he expected and secretly follows a visiting Gwen into an another Earth where his actions soon draw the attention of a larger temporal Spider squad. Motivated by his feelings for Gwen and a desire to do good, Miles looks to undo the damage that the Spot is causing across various Earths and learns that each one has its own version of Spider-man or Woman to protect it. At this point the film goes into overdrive as Miles learns more about his past and how he became Spider-Man but also learns more about the cost that his powers enact on his life and those around him. There are plenty of special moments and guest appearances that follow from the more obscure to the mainstream and the range of emotions from the audience at the press screening as they reacted to the film showed they were deeply engaged and loving it. The film does take a darker turn and does end in a cliffhanger which sets up the next film very well but also may be a bit darker than younger viewers might want. That being said; I enjoyed this film far more than I did the prior film. I found the animation style a bit off-putting as the jerky way the characters moved was a bit much over the length of a feature film. This time around there is a mix of animation styles throughout and at times in the same frame which may be a bit hard for some as the film does come at the viewer with waves of flashing lights, sounds, and animations that very cleverly mimic reading a comic complete with small boxes to define various characters from time to time. The film runs nearly two and a half hours and did seem to go on a bit long at times but thanks to the great voice-acting and strong cast as well as engaging storyline I found myself eagerly looking forward to the next film. I first saw a rough cut of a scene at Cinemacon in 2022 and it was amazing seeing the final scene near the opening of the film as it was a rare instance of a film surpassing expectations and delivers the storyline and action with a good dose of solid characters that fans will love. 4.5 stars out of 5', 'most_watched_genres': [('Other', None)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '60%', 'review': 'Sad night tonight.

The conceptualisation behind the hybrid styles of animation is spectacular and executed in an highly polished fashion - as you’d expect. The story is all over the pace though, and the proliferation of Spidey’s seemed designed more to allow the narrative to become more culturally inclusive (and bankable) rather than to develop any meaningful characterisations. What personas there are spend their time wallowing in a mire of unrequited and/or confused familial love, or teenage angst more suitable in a soap. The dialogue has it’s moments - assuming you can catch it - and there’s a bit of humour to be found but I found the audio mix made following all that was said became a bit wearisome after a first hour that really does depend on your having watched (and remembering) the first - in my view far better - instalment.

But that can be a tremendous blessing, especially when we’re confronted by circumstances where such aptitudes are called for. So it is for Roz (Lupita Nyong’o), a robot who inadvertently ends up stranded on a remote island when the vessel transporting her crashes without warning. Roz isn’t alone, though; she finds herself surrounded by a diverse array of forest animals who, curious though they might be, don’t quite know what to make of the mysterious metallic stranger. Meanwhile, the somewhat bewildered new arrival is out of her anticipated element, too, expecting to be in the company of humans for whom she’s been programmed to function as a domestic servant. However, the fundamental disconnect between these parties gradually dissipates as they each get to know one another, particularly when Roz needs to grow beyond her innate programming to overcome a series of challenges and bond with her new organic familiars, most notably a young goose (Kit Connor) whom she’s charged with raising when the gosling’s parents are accidently killed. Before long, Roz develops a sentience that helps her evolve beyond a collection of circuits and microchips, a development that proves valuable in a world beset by even bigger issues. In his latest animated feature outing, writer-director Chris Sanders has created a thoughtful, entertaining tale with an uplifting message we can all draw upon when life ups the ante on us. The picture’s stunningly gorgeous animation, solid writing, and delightfully amusing voiceover performances by the likes of Nyong’o and co-stars Pedro Pascal, Bill Nighy, Mark Hamill, Catherine O’Hara, Ving Rhames and Stephanie Hsu collectively deliver a fine mix of hearty laughs, inspiring insights and touching moments, all without becoming silly or saccharine. Admittedly, the film has a little trouble finding its footing at the outset, and a few story threads feel a little underdeveloped, such as subplots related to important but underexplained environmental themes. What’s more, it can be somewhat mystifying at times trying to figure out exactly who this offering was made for, as the material often comes across as a little more mature and decidedly more intense than what one might expect for younger viewers (despite its adorable depictions of its funny, furry forest creatures). However, these modest shortcomings are more than made up for the further one gets into the story, growing progressively stronger as the narrative unfolds. Most importantly, though, it’s gratifying to see a production that genuinely rises above the low bar that has been set for many releases in this genre these days. “The Wild Robot” is one of those films that’s sure to please a wide range of moviegoers, including those who generally aren’t particularly enamored with animation.

Young Prince Ashitaka, the last royal of his line, slays a wild boar that is about to attack his village. The boar, demonised because it was consumed by rage and hatred, infects the young Prince, who will eventually become demonised too. He leaves the village to find a cure in the form of Shishigami, a deer-like god. On his journey he realises that the latent rage and hatred within him, when it surfaces, gives him enormous power – proven when he slices off the arms of a Samurai warrior and decapitates another one. On his journey, he sees a travelling group of people attacked by a wolf pack. He saves two of the men who, it turns out, are from Irontown, run by the Lady Ishobi. He brings the two men back to Irontown, which is peopled by women who do the foundry-work and chores, and men who provide the security and protection, although even that is not cut and dried as the women are capable of defending themselves with guns being manufactured especially for them by the lepers to whom the Lady Ishobi provides food and dignity. There is much humour when the women verbally chastise their menfolk. I found those scenes hilarious. When Ashitaka brings the men back to Irontown he is welcomed by the Lady Ishobi. He also discovers that the wolf pack was led by the wolf god Moro, and the strange girl he saw help the wolves was San, the adopted daughter of Moro. San has the ability to talk to the nature spirits, and she is therefore known as Princess Mononoke (“Spirits of things”). Ashitaka is concerned that Ishobi is destroying the forest. It turns out that the Lady Ishobi and Moro are in battle because of the damage being done to the forest. To add to this, Ishobi has also recruited Samurai to help her in her fight, but the Samurai have two motives: one is to take the head of the Forest Spirit back to the Emperor, who believes it will give him immortality. The second is to take Irontown from the Lady Ishobi. That is an abstract of the plot. Miyazaki used computer-generated graphics in this for the first time, but most of the film was generated by hand. This I think is to its benefit. The drawing is breathtaking in places, and the depiction of such supernatural events as the Forest Spirit changing into the Nightwalker and the scene of the demon-possessed boar when it emerges from the forest for the first time are spectacular. I think it’s too scary and bloody for children, but a friend assures me that this sort of film is par for the course for children in Japan. The film is over two hours long, and it does pack a lot into that two hours. I found this film very interesting and watchable. I wanted to know what happened, and the plot was certainly not predictable. I believed in the world it depicted. I think in any film you have to allow it to draw you into its world (up to a point, some films are ludicrous and expect too much, this isn’t one of them). Part of the reason for the film’s ability to keep me interested is because the characters cannot be labelled “goodies” and “baddies.” Yes, Moro and his pack are attacking helpless workers, but they are destroying the forest and he needs to protect his way of life. Yes, the Lady Ishobi is destroying the forest, but she’s making a living for herself and is helping others: she has removed the women from servitude in brothels, given them security, work, and a home; some have found husbands or companions. She has provided shelter, home and work for the lepers, normally outcasts. Neither side seems particularly vindictive; Ishobi’s attempts to rid herself of the wolf pack are for self preservation, and her coalition with the Samurai to destroy the Forest Spirit is her attempt to remove the constant threat of attack. One can argue that if she took a more conciliatory view, maybe some sort of truce could be reached, but time and again members of the wolf pack merely say “they are humans, they must be killed” – to the point that even Ashitaki, who has helped the animals – is threatened with death if he does not leave the forest. In fact, one could argue that it is the animals who show a “racist” attitude here – demanding the death of the humans because they are humans. None of the humans in the film demand the death of the animals simply because they are animals. Their deaths, and the destruction of their habitat, are an unfortunate side-effect of the humans’ industrialisation, not a deliberate act. I hope that what you see from my analysis above is that the film is not goodies v. baddies. It’s nature v. industrialisation, and the compromise to that is not an easy one, and the film reflects that. You’ll be happy to know the film does have an upbeat ending, but thankfully it’s not entirely predictable, in my opinion.

It\'s 1984 and director Robert Zemeckis, fresh from the success of Romancing The Stone, is trying to film Back To the Future - a film about a young teenager called Marty McFly who is accidentally sent back in time to 1955 and inadvertently risks the future of his family. Zemeckis is troubled by his leading man, Eric Stoltz, who just isn\'t capturing the youthful teenager exuberance that he wants for Marty McFly. Stoltz is jettisoned and in comes Michael J. Fox who was busy wowing audiences in the hugely popular sit-com Family Ties. Fox had been first choice anyway but couldn\'t get a release slot from shooting with Family Ties. Luckily the wasted time with Stoltz created an opening for Fox to play Marty McFly as well as work on the show - the result of which would turn out to be one of the most beloved fantasy trilogies of the modern era. It\'s honestly hard to find anyone who seriously doesn\'t like Back To The Future part one. The second one has its critics, because, lets face it, it\'s a bridge between two better films, while the third film loses some people because of its Western themed plot (the heathens that they are). Yet really this trilogy opener is as near perfect cinema for all the family as you could wish to view. It\'s a water tight script from Zemeckis and Bob Gale that not only encompasses witty time travel paradoxes, but also dares to be dramatic into the bargain. The first 15 minutes contains a real shocker that is as cheeky as it bold, something that really gives Marty\'s 1955 quest a real urgency that the audience can buy into as the comedy relief then comes in spades. The set pieces are first rate - hello skateboard - hello rock ""n"" roll 101, and the makers have fun in winking towards other notable sci-fi pictures along the way. Hell they even manage to deal in an Oedipal strand that is tasteful, handled superbly and garners guffaws aplenty. No mean feat that last one actually. Alan Silvestri provides a whirring & pleasing score and the theme song, The Power Of Love, by Huey Lewis & The News, is infectiously enjoyable. Finally it\'s the cast that seal the deal for why this is as good as it gets for fantasy escapist cinema. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson & Crispin Glover are the perfect quintet, each feeding off each other and doing justice to the excellently constructed story. Made for $19 million, Back To The Future went on to make a worldwide gross of over $381 million, and those are the kind of figures you really can\'t argue with.

Back To The Future represents one of those films, such a powerful, inspirational, comical, heartwarming, and innovative one. Probably, McFly and Doc Brown proffer the best duo-interaction I have ever beheld in an 80s film (which, happily, could end up being top-notch of all time). There are almost no blunders to be found because the flick essentially represents an instant classic of cinematic history as if to say, pure perfection. From this moment on, you might be thinking about the reason of having assessed the film as absolute perfection score. First and foremost, we discuss relating to breaking formulas and experiencing new paths, in other words, means opening new cinematic genres and improving them, that is to say, films which leave a significant legacy. Back To The Future follows the proper steps to provide that brand-new feature we were all hoping. Secondly, we balance the film\'s highest moments and ordinary moments with humour, some 50\'s nostalgia, some drama and (even) some action moments which results in a win-win the film provides a mixture of genres carefully well-managed and accurately-needed. Third, if the goal is the production of an instant classic, we will need to focus on the cast, because they are the ones who will perform during the whole film, they embody the heroes and villains; therefore, they become fundamental. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the film\'s core, as excellent as Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson\'s 2005 Wedding Crashers, I daresay. Finally, but not least, the soundtrack and the environment, in spite of ending up being complementary, provides not only a trusting reality but an opportunity to show the audience the plot\'s main incidents. During the display, we will notice the most recurrent spots are the 80\'s and 50\'s at school, at traditional coffee shops and the streets, not forgetting the excellent pop-culture references introduced. The audience ought to congratulate Robert Zemeckis\' mind and, also, the crucial support of his staff (one of whom was Steve Spielberg) owing to this masterpiece. The montage is proof that everyone who has an incredible imagination is capable of creating chef-d\'oeuvres, delivering the audience such an extraordinary time.

As his colleagues at the wake suffer from excesses of saké their traditionally stiff, reserved, view of their late friend becomes more of a tool to evaluate their own roles and purpose as they determine to be more like him....

Drawing on the public perception of the similarities between himself and Adolf Hitler - not just his toothbrush moustache but also their upbringings - Chaplin sought to directly parody and attack the German führer and fascism. InThe Great Dictator, Adenoid Hynkel (Chaplin) rules Tomania and sets about his conquest of the world. In doing so, he persecutes Jewish people, including a former veteran of World War I who is now a barber (also Chaplin). Unsurprisingly, the film was a hit on release, resonating well with the anti-Nazi sentiment in both American and British public. Chaplin understood that delivering his political message was so important that he forewent his usual desire for a silent film in order to get his message across. Sound is used to great effect inThe Great Dictator. By studying many of Hitler\'s speeches, Chaplin was able to create a ludicrous, yet believable, gibberish parody of the Nazi leader\'s oratory style. Of course, the physical comedy remains, typically reserved for the barber (who may or may not be Chaplin\'s silent hero, The Tramp). This combination of physical comedy and irreverent one liners together makes the film feel like a very early Carry On. WhileThe Great Dictatorremains arguably Chaplin\'s best ""talkie"", it often feels like it is the end of Chaplin\'s era of classical pantomime. People being hit on the head with a saucepan comes across as a cheap laugh and it is often the verbal jokes that are the cleverest. Overall the comedy has not aged well. ButThe Great Dictatorwas never designed for longevity. It was perfect propaganda for the Allies, released at a perfect point in the War. For that reason, The Great Dictator can only be judged in the context of its release.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 13), ('Comedy', 5), ('Romance', 5), ('History', 4), ('Other', 14)]}]",100,Yes!

This movie is really special. Not only does it show us a lot about the world of Hollywood during its golden age, but it also reveals a lot about the actors' egos, vanities and their titanic struggles to preserve their careers and stay in the limelight. Brilliantly directed by Billy Wilder, it is considered by many to be one of the great movie classics, combining entertainment, artistic value and cultural relevance. In 1951, it won three Oscars (Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction in a Black and White Film, Best Comic Film Soundtrack) and could perfectly have won one more, for Best Actress. But awards like these are never completely fair, especially in years so fertile for good films. Starting with the iconic scene of the dead man in the pool, the film intrigues us, and curiosity grips us, as the film shows how it all happened, introducing us to an average screenwriter who struggles to write a successful script that can leverage his career. He owes money, is in serious trouble and takes advantage of the opportunity to earn some easy money at the expense of a retired silent film actress, who decides to hire him to revise and type a script, written by herself and designed to mark her return. The script is mediocre, and he knows that the film will never happen, but he is coerced into silence, becoming the privileged eyewitness of the former star's gradual loss of lucidity. Of course, things get complicated as he loses his individual freedom and becomes more dependent on the whims and desires of his mistress. Despite the fiction, the film is based a lot on several loose true facts: one of them, the most obvious, is the fall of several actors in the course of the transition from silent to talking films. There were great actors who looked magnificent on screen and had great physical and facial expression, but who didn't survive this transition due to things as prosaic as a poor English fluency or a strange accent. Others, however, simply did not know how to understand and adapt to the novelty. The collapse of their careers and personal lives led to alcoholism, drugs, mental disorders. The film is able to condense almost all of this into a single character: Norma Desmond, the epitome of the fallen star. The cast has several well-known names, three of which – William Holden, Erich Von Stroheim and, obviously, Gloria Swanson – offer us the interpretation of their lives and their work of greater value and recognition. Of course, we cannot ignore that Swanson was a great star of silent cinema and that she shone in films like “Trespasser” or “Indiscreet”, and that Holden would continue to be a highly sought actor after this, having won his Oscar for Best Actor in a film that starred two years later. But there is no doubt that this film immortalized the three of them. Technically, the film is impeccable, and the merit lies a lot in the brilliance of the dialogues, in the excellence of the conception and development of the characters, in the extraordinary way in which Wilder managed to get the best out of Swanson and lead the actress to a magnificent performance, which has so much to brilliant and difficult as well as provocative (especially from the point of view of many Hollywood shooting stars, who saw themselves in character and felt offended by it). With an excellent pace, the film does not waste time or let the atmosphere of tension and drama fall into a standstill. The mansion, owned by the Getty family, acquires character by itself as it becomes the most obvious symbol of the disturbed personality and only of its resident. The black and white cinematography is magnificent, and accentuates, in its details and shooting angles, the dramatic feel of the film. The soundtrack isn't memorable, but it's effective and functional."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': '""Gillis"" (William Holden) is a down-at-heel script writer who is struggling to keep his head above water. Not having had any successes for a while, his car is about to be repossessed and his erstwhile boss ""Sheldrake"" (Fred Clark) has nothing for him. On the run from the pursuing repo men, he turns his car into the drive of a decaying old mansion. Hiding his car in the garage, he is mistaken by the house\'s owner for an undertaker - she has a small matter that needs attending too! Realising her error she demands he leave, but not before he mentions what he does for a living. She has a script. Hundreds of pages of script - and she offers him a job, champagne and caviar if he will edit and refine it so ""Norma Desmond"" (Gloria Swanson), a retired former silent movie star, can present it to her favourite director Cecil B DeMille and restart her glorious career. Initially just seeing dollar signs, he agrees and what now ensues is a masterfully crafted story of love, dependency, ambition and delusion in which Swanson absolutely shines. It\'s clear to us from the outset that her grasp on reality is somewhat limited, and but for her dedicated factotum ""Max"" (Erich von Stroheim) she might well have fallen victim to her own depression many years ago. Holden is also on solid form here, his initial selfishness starts to morph into something more, he begins to care for this woman whose head is increasingly in the clouds, and upon whom she is becoming more reliant. The dialogue is delivered via a mix of Holden\'s quite honest narrative and the conversations between the characters delivering some of the best lines in cinema - ""I\'m still big - it\'s the world that\'s got smaller!"". The mental decline and instability of ""Desmond"" is expertly displayed here by a star who new a thing or two herself about the silent film scene, and who brings her facial expressions, her mannerisms and her generally star-studded demeanour to bear really effectively as the audience gradually realise that nothing here is going to pan out as it seems - or as anyone wants. Von Stroheim underplays his supporting role with aplomb and though I didn\'t really love the sub-plot with Nancy Olson\'s ""Betty Schaefer"" - it took away from the intensity of the main storyline - it did to serve to illustrate just how powerful jealousy can be.

Dead Poets Society is directed by Peter Weir (Picnic At Hanging Rock/Gallipoli) and stars Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Kurtwood Smith, Gale Hansen & Norman Lloyd. The script is written by Tom Schulman, based on his life at Montgomery Bell Academy, an all-boys preparatory school in Nashville, Tennessee. The film is set in 1959 at the fictional Welton Academy in Vermont (location shoot from St. Andrew's School in Middletown, Delaware). The story follows that of English teacher John Keating who uses his different method of teaching to inspire his students to be all that they can be whilst warning of the perils of conformity. Dead Poets Society was a monster smash hit that made almost $220 million profit in Worldwide box office takings. Not bad considering this was the year that film lovers flocked to see the likes of Batman, Lethal Weapon 2 and the third outing for one Indiana Jones. It showed that there was a mainstream market for serious drama if it is done well. And rest assured, Dead Poets Society is done well, very well in fact. Its launchpad is Schulman's Academy Award winning script that puts under the microscope educational conformity and the ogres that are parental and peer pressure. Enter the inspired casting of Robin Wiliams (nominated for BAFTA & Academy Award for Best Actor) as the teacher who urges his charges to see outside of the box that they have been placed in. Young men, soon to be full adults, who have their lives mapped out for them, are challenged by Mr Keating to be spontaneous, to pursue idealism and view life with new perspectives. Coming two years after he was nominated for Good Morning Vietnam, Williams once and for all proves to his doubters that he is a quality dramatic actor. His Keating is charismatic but without the mad-cap histrionics that Williams is famed for. Very controlled, in that what is in essence a catalyst role, Keating hasn't rushed to become said catalyst. He's a constant sympathetic presence, a father figure type, yet a confidential friend too. That Schulman's script has avoided the usual clichés that come with teacher-student relations in film's helps Williams as an actor to breath intelligent life into Keating. Even the flecks of humour that Williams is allowed to work from, such as Brando doing Shakespeare, play with a warmth that's essential to the relationships forming in the piece. Tho it's unquestionably Williams' movie (the film soars when he is on screen), the young cast playing the students get an A + for their sensitive portrayals. Notably Robert Sean Leonard (heartfelt), Ethan Hawke (haunting) & Gale Hansen (punky). While Kurtwood Smith leaves an indelible image as a domineering father. In the hands of Weir, the film, unsurprisingly to his fans, carries an air of mysticism too. Again working with one of his regular DOP's, John Seale, Weir knows how to capture the time, place and people in his movies; while cloaking them in dashes of mystical beauty. Be it the boys striding around the school grounds amidst autumnal hues, or plodding wearily thru the snowy terrain as Winter kicks in, Weir gives the scenes an apt poetic quality. It's also of note that these scenes, as well as the cave sequences where the Dead Poets Society meetings take place, blend with the characters emotional states. Sprightly and optimistic around the greenery, nervous and excited in the darkened cave, then heavy of heart and leg as the fall accompanies the emotionally turbulent last quarter. A last quarter that leads to what has now become a divisive ending. Some have (and will) come away from it irked and claiming it to be syrupy. Others such as myself find it uplifting, hopeful and a fitting end to the emotional roller-coaster that cast and crew have taken us on. Is your glass half full or half empty? An excellent and intelligent story is directed and acted accordingly, with its themes making it actually one of the best Punk Rock movies out there. 9/10"", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 43), ('Thriller', 42), ('Crime', 34), ('Action', 29), ('Other', 111)]}, {'writer': 'Wuchak', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'Seize the day; be Exceptional! John Keating (Robin Williams), a new teacher at a stuffy prep school in 1959, inspires his students to capitalize on their natural talents and develop a passion for life because they only have one shot and in 60 years or so they\'ll all be worm-food. Each boy starts to act on Keating\'s dynamic ideas with explosive consequences , both good and bad. Released in 1989 and directed by Peter Weir, ""Dead Poets Society"" is a coming-of-age drama that\'s one of the most inspiring films ever made and ranks with my all-time favorite movies. The film captivates from the very beginning and doesn\'t release until it\'s over. That\'s when you KNOW a movie\'s really good, regardless of the subject matter. The cinematography and locations are top rate, shot in the Middletown region of Delaware (although the story itself takes place in Vermont). The quiet Fall & Winter scenes are breathtaking. This is not a spoiler, but there\'s a powerful scene at the climax where the students give Keating a daring final salute. Roger Ebert criticized the scene as ""so moving he wanted to throw up,"" but he\'s dead wrong. It is both unexpected and potent. The film contains a wealth of riches to mine in subsequent viewings, and I don\'t just mean the insights conjured from the poetry & prose. Here are a handful off the top of my head: ""The letter kills,"" referring to the legalistic nature of Neil\'s joyless father and most of the teachers at the school; the type of Judas (Cameron); the scapegoat (Keating); the stunning nature of feminine beauty (when Chris appears at the entrance of the school and the guys\' mouths drop); the marvels of nature and how they\'re conducive to inspiration & spirituality; Keating\'s heartbroken countenance after Neil is removed from the theater crowd (Keating knows there\'s little he can do about the authoritarian mistreatment). There are a couple of insignificant scenes that don\'t work so well, but that\'s always the case, even with the best of films. One possible objection is that one boy\'s tragedy goes against the very message of the film to ""seize the day."" I disagree. The kid really started to ""seize the day"" but his passions were quenched by someone who didn\'t share Keating\'s mindset and he unfortunately couldn\'t handle it. Again, dynamic ideas have explosive consequences, good and bad. The other kids had varying results with their attempts to ""seize the day."" Some made progress in attaining their dreams and others got in trouble because they threw wisdom to the wind. The varying results make the story realistic. Another criticism was voiced by a reviewer who stated that the late night meetings at the cave to read poetry and inspire one another were ""homo erotic."" This interpretation could only be derived by an adult in our gay-obsessed modern culture. The kids in the film are about 16-17 years-old. This was the only way they could go out and have fun under the strict rules of a New England prep school in 1959. I remember when I was a teenager going out to the treehouse with several guys and drinking & smoking; we\'d sometimes discuss metal/rock lyrics, which could be viewed as a delinquent form of poetry, and other such things. Sometimes we\'d bring a girl or three. Likewise, in two of the cave meetings in the film one of the guys brings a couple babes from another school whilst the others look on in awe; on two other occasions a guy brings nude pages of whoa-men. I think that pretty much quells the ""homo-erotic"" theory. Most of those who scoff at this film\'s message go back to their 9 to 5 slavery (or 3 to 11 or 11 to 7, etc.) with no light at the end of the mundane tunnel. I encourage such people to give the film a second look. But BEWARE, there are no moronic explosions, CGI, non-stop \'action,\' gore, OTT cussing, nudity or sex scenes; I know that\'s completely shocking, but it\'s true. Then I would encourage these people to take a good look at their lives and ask: Are you willing to change it? Throw off the shackles? Throw caution to the wind and pursue your true calling, your dream? Will you ""sieze the day""? Or will you continue to stagnate in a puddle of mediocrity? The answer that comes back will usually determine if this film becomes a favorite or not. FINAL ANALYSIS: Australian director Peter Weir has other good films like ""Witness"" and ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" (the latter is, incidentally, a film about an ALL-GIRLS school and can be boring if you\'re not in the mood for an ultra-mystery yarn), but ""Dead Poets Society"" is his best. Check it out. Give it a second (or third) chance if you haven\'t already. It\'s an outstanding story and it\'ll inspire you, especially if you\'ve fallen into a life-stifling, growth-stultifying rut of drudgery. The film runs just over two hours (128 minutes).

Strange though the synopsis may be, the relationship between Léon and Mathilda is kept innocent, and the scenes between the two are believable. Mathilda’s sexual awareness is at a nascent stage and her exposure to the sordid side of life with her recently deceased family (her step-father worked for drug-dealers) means she is perhaps not as innocent as most 12-year old girls; however, Léon is unwilling to take advantage of the situation. This means the story can focus on the platonic relationship between the two, the bond that develops between them, and how each affects the other’s life. Although it may seem a little far-fetched that a young girl would accompany a hitman during his work, Léon ensures that her assistance is required only on fairly routine hits that follow a well-defined pattern. For the more complex hits he leaves her behind. There is a thread of humour running through the film, but you must bear in mind the film is framed in the world of corruption and greed and all is not sweet and light, and graphic violence is depicted. Jean Reno is wonderful as the extremely good but placid hitman, whose whole outlook on life is changed by the young Mathilda, played wonderfully by Natalie Portman in her first film.

Mima Kirigoe. A pop-idol. An actress. An X-rated model. Public image and its personifying echoes circulate around the world, adhering to the desires of endearing fans alike. But when their inspirational idol haphazardly shifts career, from pop sensation to dramatic actress, the psychosis of the modern consumer society ultimately changes with her. Saddened, angered and crazed. Mima’s abrupt persona altering career move may have developed maddened stalkers, including her fantastically imagined past self haunting the newly suppressed version. The late Satoshi Kon was known for seamlessly blending fantasy with reality. Depicting an opaque blurred line between delusions and actualities. None more so, than in his exaggerated psychologically disturbed work in Perfect Blue. For many the art form of Japanese animation, commonly titled as “anime”, is cited as “childish”. “Anime is for losers” tweeted kickboxer Andrew Tate. Well, if like Mr. Tate you believe anime to be childish, I implore you to watch Perfect Blue. Without illustrating the voyeuristic nature of Murai’s narrative, it is the most accessibly invigorating piece of psychological stimulation, that is strictly aimed towards adults, to ever be constructed from this art form. The complete metamorphosis of a character that questions her own perceived identity through inquisitional explicit acts of graphic nature. Exploring the psychosis of shared delusional disorder and the acute harassment of an obsessive stalker. Kon establishes a murder mystery whilst inciting the emasculation of a vulnerable female’s world. Male controllers, likened to manipulative deities of authoritative powers, are gradually weakened by a mysterious individual. Culminating into a twistingly fragmented climax that grants Mima the independence that she was repressed from. Kon’s intelligence in foreshadowing, the drama series ‘Double Bind’ essentially replicating Mima’s regressive state of mind, allows the audience to question several aspects. He smartly manages to maintain the central mystery without deterring from Mima’s mental instability. He doesn’t stop there though. Kon refuses to relinquish thematic presence in every frame. Exploring the fragility of a rape victim and the traumatisation of such an explicitly heightened ordeal. The dangers of online anonymity and the tarnishing of existing careers. Challenging the extremities of art in all its mediums. The realism of Perfect Blue is what forces its story to be so utterly terrifying. It’s not just a psychological thriller. It’s horror. Kon’s signature animation style is gloriously vibrant as always, with attentive detail towards realistic environments. The grotesque facial features of “Me-Mania”, only possible in this art form, heighten the natural malformed detest we have for him. Ikumi’s audacious score enables the heart to palpitate more frequently with its sharp tones and ethereal voices. And, as rare as this is, the English dub is surprisingly decent. The reality is that Perfect Blue transcends the medium that it is presented in. It stimulates through Kon’s trademark visceral style, allowing the dangers of early Internet culture to produce a thrilling psychologically adept feature that blurs fantasy with reality. I mean, for a film to make me stand up, clap my hands and utter the words “perfection”, it has to be something special right?. Well, Perfect Blue is special, because it is perfect. And yes, with that said it does indeed garner the perfect rating.

Western movies made in co-production by Italians and Americans (called ""spaghetti-western"") have been considered among the best that emerged within their genre, cleverly combining the tough action of Wild West gunslingers with the taste for raw realism and detail of the Italian filmmakers. I believe that such a thing may displease North Americans, who consider the cowboy a figure that is ""true USA"". I therefore invite them to visit the Brazilian city of Barretos, or the rural areas of Goiás, Mato Grosso or Tocantins in Brazil. There are plenty of cowboys there… they just lack the guns. Sergio Leone is an unavoidable figure here, having been responsible for the greatest “spaghetti” ever made. In this film, he gives us again a remarkable job, full of qualities. I don\'t consider it the best of his career or the best ""spaghetti western"" ever made, but it definitely has a place on the podium. The film begins very well, with the massacre of an Irish immigrant and his family, which leaves in the hands of a second wife – yes, the man was secretly a bigamist – a few acres of uninteresting desert... but there are people willing to kill for it. It happens that the smart Irishman had bought the only viable land for the railroad, and had even acquired the right to build a station and a new settlement! In the middle, we still have a gunslinger in search of personal revenge and another, in the pay of the railroad itself. Let\'s face things frankly: the movie is good. It\'s a classic in its own right, almost mandatory for any movie lover, which doesn\'t mean that it\'s mandatory to like it! It is not a perfect film, it has problems that we will talk about, but it is equally endowed with characteristics and qualities that deserve to be valued. The cinematography is very elegant, with good light and color. The sets and costumes are beautiful, even if it is frankly difficult to set a date to the film. In addition to the fact that the script does not establish a rigorous chronology, it\'s clear that the concern of the production designer and costume designers was aesthetics rather than historical rigor because there is a mixture of props, clothing and objects from the 1870s, 1880s and 1860. Is it a minor problem? Yes, but it is still a problem and a sign of the carelessness with which many productions are still facing historical rigor nowadays. The visual and special effects are put to good use and the soundtrack, atmospheric and truly impactful, is one of Ennio Morricone\'s most powerful works. Unfortunately, the film\'s editing was not the best, with cuts so abrupt and violent that it almost leads one to believe that the film was cut ""a posteriori"" for some reason. And perhaps the biggest problem turns out to be its excessively slow and annoying construction, with each scene lasting three minutes longer than necessary and the general length reaching three hours unnecessarily. We can only say good things about the cast: among a vast succession of unknown and unimportant Italians, there are some outstanding actors who do not disappoint us and give us magnificent interpretations. Charles Bronson is a good-hearted tough guy with a monstrous charisma that steals our attention whenever he appears. Henry Fonda is effective as a villain, showing the actor\'s enormous versatility. Claudia Cardinale, one of the muses of cinema at the time, combines an impressive resilience of spirit, a high dose of charisma and a beauty that is still remembered today. Jason Robards has the difficult task of being the helpful good guy who ends badly to glorify the hero, but he takes the opportunity to show all his value as an actor.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'JPV852', 'score': '90%', 'review': 'Great western that I never watched despite owning the old DVD, but with Paramount releasing this on 4K UHD, decided to sit down through the 165-minute duration and it was a wonderful experience.

When a great flood essentially destroys the world of man, a wide-eyed black cat must figure out how to get by when this consuming deluge wipes out the existence he has known, armed with only his own wits and the cooperation of fellow animal kindreds, including a capybara, a meerkat, a secretary bird and a pack of dogs, most notably a yellow Labrador retriever. Together this band of different creatures navigates the waters of this new world in an abandoned sailboat, learning how to work together to support one another and to stay alive, surmounting an array of challenges along the way. In the process, they collectively learn valuable life lessons that we as humans can all stand to follow, especially when confronted with circumstances not unlike those that we all must contend with in a world on the edge, conditions to which most of us can probably relate these days. The answers that these creatures come up with are often patently obvious, but the film thoughtfully prompts us to ask ourselves that, if these simple solutions are so readily apparent, why aren’t we doing more ourselves to embrace them in addressing our own current challenges? That’s a very good question and one of the greatest strengths of this widely acclaimed release. This dialogue-free offering, whose only sounds come from the authentic utterances of its animal protagonists and its emotive background score, features exquisite animation in its depiction of a world in transition, one showing the remnants of what’s been left behind and the emergence of what’s coming into being. While the narrative takes a little time to initially find its footing and is occasionally episodic as it unfolds, the various incidents it portrays as the story plays out are instructive, touching, meaningful and spot on in conveying the picture’s myriad insights, crafted in a way that shows more than tells and successfully avoids the temptation to spoon-feed audiences. “Flow” may be animated, but it’s by no means a cartoon, an accomplishment to which more films in this genre should attempt to aspire.

Memorable scenes abound, starting with the mind-blowing opening with Willard (Martin Sheen) having a mental breakdown in his sweltering Saigon hotel room to the tune of The Doors\' ""The End."" Speaking of Sheen, people overlook the fact that he expertly carries the film. His haunting commentary is one of the most effective narrations in cinematic history and hooks the viewer into the nightmare-adventure. I could go on and on about the noteworthy scenes, but I\'ll resist, except to comment on Col. Kurtz: Was he really insane or actually a bold genius? General Corman informs Willard: ""He\'s out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops."" And, yet, Kurtz was accomplishing what the US military couldn\'t or wouldn\'t do because of political complications and niceties. I bring this up because, as I\'ve aged, I\'ve come to see that I\'M Kurtz in some ways -- operating ""out there"" beyond the parameters and restrictions typically linked to my work. The script was written by John Milius with alterations by Coppola as he shot the film whilst the narration was written by Michael Herr. The meaning of the story is obvious: The trip up the river led by Capt. Willard exposes him to two extreme viewpoints of war represented by the two colonels he encounters on his long journey, both of whose names start with \'K,\' which is no accident: Lt. COL. KILGORE (Duvall) is a romantic who embraces war as a lifestyle and even feeds off it, i.e. glorifies it. The fact that he\'s a romantic can be observed in the air-raid on the village where he literally plays Wagner as a prologue. He feeds off the war to the extent that he ""loves the smell of napalm in the morning."" War is just another day to him so why not go surfing? Since he lives off of the war there\'s no way it can kill him or even give him a scratch. Kilgore naturally has the support of the top brass because he\'s part of the system and plays the game of war. COL. KURTZ (Brando), by contrast, sees through this hypocrisy. He realizes that being in a state of war is humanity gone mad. It\'s living horror and therefore must be ended through the quickest means possible at whatever cost. He refuses to play the game of war as he expertly takes out double agents, etc. Of course the brass can\'t have this so they put out a hit on Kurtz via Willard. The existential Kurtz becomes increasingly disillusioned -- even crazy -- after jumping ship from the system and now has no sanctuary. Death is the only way out. His consolation is that Willard will tell his son the truth. The ""Redux"" version was put together by Coppola and released in 2001 with the addition of 49 minutes of material that he originally cut, not to mention placing Clean\'s surfing scene later in the story. Coppola made the right decisions with his original 1979 edit of the film (2 hours, 33 minutes) since the extra footage of ""Redux"" tends to drag the film down with 1 or 2 scenes being dubiously scripted, e.g. the theft of Kilgore\'s surf board. Not every idea that is birthed during the creative process is worthy of the final product and ""Redux"" illustrates this. Thus the new footage of ""Redux"" should\'ve arguably been relegated to the ""deleted scenes"" section. That said, I\'ve warmed up to ""Redux"" and feel it\'s a worthy version of the film, but onlyifyou\'ve watched the Theatrical Cut andwant more. ""Redux"" successfully fleshes out the characters and gives them more dimension, especially Willard and Kurtz. Plus the sequence involving Kurtz reading a couple of TIME magazine articles illustrates beyond any shadow of doubt that hewasn\'tinsane and that the brass simply slandered him as crazy in order to justify the assassination of a decorated American officer. Coppola\'s preferred cut of the film is the ""Final Cut,"" released in 2019, which runs a half hour longer than the Theatrical Cut. In other words, it trims the fat off of ""Redux."" There\'s also a ""First Assembly"" version, a bootleg, that runs 4 hours, 49 minutes. The film was shot in the Philippines.

Apocalypse Now is directed by Francis Ford Coppola who also co-adapts the screenplay with John Milius from Heart of Darkness written by Joseph Conrad. It stars Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford, Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms and Albert Hall. Cinematography is by Vittorio Storaro and the music is primarily arranged by Carmine Coppola. The Vietnam War and Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Sheen) is approached by American intelligence to go on a secret assignment: he's to follow the Nung River into the remote Cambodian jungle to find and assassinate Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a member of the US Army Special Forces who has gone insane. One of the most talked and written about films of all time, Apocalypse Now remains to this day a harrowing and haunting experience to first time viewers. With a production shoot that has in itself become legendary, Coppola's flawed masterpiece has been dissected and argued over to within an inch of its magnificent life. People will continue to write about it for ever more it seems, perhaps there might even be the odd new confrontational spin on what resides within? But ultimately it's what the individual takes away from the film that matters, our own interpretations key to the enjoyment of such a disturbing vision of war and violence. Many of the set-pieces, dialogue and characters have long since passed into folklore, and rightly so. The Ride of the Valkyries helicopter assault, Kurtz's surreal death camp, the boat people massacre, purple haze, the playmates, Kilgore, and of course the horror, the horror..indeed. The performances match the quality of Storaro's sumptuous Philippines photography, Sheen is fiercely committed and Duvall and Hopper in turn are powerhouse and edgy. While Brando, doing his own bizzaro thing in the last third, brings a little chaos unintentionally in keeping with the madness at the heart of this particular darkness. Personally that last draggy third does stop it from being a complete genius type whole, but everything up to it is so damn good it's arguably churlish to expect perfection?

It's 1916 and the French and German armies are in opposing mud trenches, when the French are ordered to undertake a suicidal assault on a German held hill, many of the soldiers are quick to realise it's an impossible order to see through to its conclusion and retreat, something which brings charges of cowardice from the military hierarchy. Someone must take the fall... Withdrawn from circulation in France at one time, unreleased in Spain as well, Paths of Glory is a shattering indictment on military hierarchy. On those General types who watch from afar through telescopic sights as men and boys are led like lambs to the slaughter, then off they go to their dinning rooms to gorge on wine and wholesome meat, the stench of rotting flesh as bad on their breaths as it is out there in no man's land. But it's OK for the war effort, while there might even be a promotion for some lucky soul in nice trousers... A two-parter, the film was adapted from the novel written by Humphrey Cobb. The first half follows the craziness of the attack, the horrors of war brutally realised as Kubrick and cinematographer Georg Krause bring out the worry and simmering anger that jostle for the soldier's souls. The camera is cold and calculating, thus perfect for the material to hand, it leads the viewers - with skillful fluidity - through the bleakness of the trenches and the desolation of no man's land, the former a foreboding place, the latter an atrocity exhibition as bodies get flayed and shattered, while others retreat with limbs or sanity barely intact. Second part shifts to a legally based procedural as the Generals conspire to make an example of those who retreated. Cowardice and a dereliction of duty apparently means the firing squad must save the integrity of the army. Patsies are lined up, but their Colonel (a superb Kirk Douglas) wants to defend them, there's much sweat, tears and anger, accusations hurled, and mistakes once again proving insurmountable. Which leads to the astonishing finale, heartbreaking whilst inducing fury, and crowned by an elegiac song that brings tears for characters and viewers alike.

Kirk Douglas takes top billing and is adequate, it\'s Macready who actually steals this for me and the director\'s wife does the briefest of scenes as a German cabaret singer, too. Again, I think cinema will focus this better than television, but either way it\'s a thought-provoking exposé of war that holds up well 60-odd years later.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Romance', 18), ('Other', 113)]}, {'writer': 'Filipe Manuel Neto', 'score': '90%', 'review': ""A short and objective film, with a clear and still relevant message, as well as a huge performance by Kirk Douglas. There are several films about World War I, but it is far from being seen by the public as one of the best. In fact, it seems to me a little forgotten today. It is, however, timely and current in its pacifist message in which the greatest absurdity of war is emphasized in a partially true story, in which a group of three French soldiers is shot by cowardice after joining an inglorious attack to a much stronger and prepared German position. Stanley Kubrick is a director to which no one gets indifferent: either if he loves or hates. He seems to have enjoyed fostering this by choosing hard themes, uncomfortable and debatable movies. This is just one more, and I, who loved some of his movies just as I hated others, decided to put this movie in the middle of the table. It is much more direct and easy to understand than most of his later work, but is nonetheless uncomfortable for the questions raised. For example, the contrasts between the ordinary soldier, mud in a trench and subject to die like an animal, and the generals, kilometers in the rear, in beautiful palaces where there is not a single shot. Intelligently, Kubrick focuses on the obvious injustice of punishment as proof of the inhuman absurdity of war and military leaders. Thus, the movie is simple, direct, short (not even one and a half hours) and abrasive. Black-and-white cinematography is very clear, luminous and works a lot of light and shadow. The edition is effective and the soundtrack almost imperceptible for discretion. The sets and costumes are worthy of a large production. However, there are no action and combat scenes do not focus on the intensity of the fight, but its most human side. It is another perspective of war: those looking for action will not have what they want, but who wants a deeper movie has a full plate here. Kirk Douglas is the protagonist, embodying a colonel who is responsible for carrying out the defense of the military under trial. The efforts he desperately leads to the last instances are notable, but as the sentence was predetermined, the court is a sordid masquerade. Douglas begins to be cordial and contained, an officer at the orders, part of the gear, but gradually changes as his character is confronted with all that brutality, and this is really a meritorious effort for any actor. I don't know his work well yet, but I wouldn't surprise me if this was one of Douglas's best movies. Unfortunately, and without disregard for Adolphe Menjou and Joe Turkel's efforts, the rest of the cast does not accompany him at all."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}]",100,Yes!

I mean, who hasn’t seen this movie yet? If by some extraordinary circumstances you’re one of those unlucky souls, stop. Spend the next hour and a half watching this animated masterpiece and come back here. I will still avoid mentioning key details because I’m just used to it, and The Lion King has so many things to compliment that I don’t really need to get in-depth on spoilers. So, in case you haven’t notice it through my Twitter or occasional mentions in other reviews, The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time (animated or not)! I rewatched it for the 312358th time this last weekend, and I cried more than when I was just a child. That’s how much this movie means to me. The sense of nostalgia plus the overwhelming emotions throughout the runtime are tear-inducing aspects that I can’t simply avoid. I literally cried (waterfalls) in four (!) different scenes. The opening sequence (Circle of Life) filled my eyes with nostalgia’s tears. Mufasa’s tragic moment obviously wrecked me (one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the history of cinema). Simba receiving the whole “remember who you are” speech from Mufasa in the clouds is incredibly inspirational and therefore worthy of some sobbing. Finally, one of the last scenes, Simba climbing his way to the top of Pride Rock with Hans Zimmer‘s score, leaving me absolutely destroyed. And I want to pick up on that last aspect: the score. It’s one of the most crucial technical features of a film, in my opinion. It can transform an “okay” scene into something magical or something pretty terrible, depending on what kind of score it is. Consequently, it can make a “good” movie turn into a “great” one. Hans Zimmer is one of my favorite composers ever. His soundtracks are always filled with such an epic vibe. Even if the film itself isn’t that good, his scores are still able to elevate it in some way. The Lion King is one of his most memorable scores due to how emotionally compelling it is, even in the subtlest moments. During the stampede sequence, the score doesn’t lend you time to breathe. Its high rhythm and continuously growing music keep any viewer at the edge of the seat, waiting for it to be over. Then, when Simba descends and approaches his dad, the score is so subtle. Completely opposite to the previous sumptuous and grand sound. It’s that nuance plus the impact of the scene itself that make me cry. In the last scene that I mentioned above, it’s solely the score that brings in the chill-inducing tears. If Simba climbed Pride Rock with no soundtrack, it would just be a good ending. However, from the exact moment that the score fades in, it instantly turns that sequence into an epic finale. The slow-motion walk to the top, the immersive score, Simba’s roar … Damn it, I’m crying again! The animation is some of Disney’s best. It’s not by chance that the Disney Renaissance Era (1989-1999), which was the return to form by Disney, has the best animation quality of its history, and a lot of the memorable movies that marked everyone’s childhood. Its expressiveness and ease to make animals emote elevates the story and its characters. There’s no need for any kind of dialogue when you can see how the characters are reacting and understand what they’re feeling. The wide shots are beautiful to look at and worthy of being anyone’s wallpaper even today. The songs are remarkable and they influenced an entire generation. Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Circle of Life, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, … Every single song is someone’s favorite. The voice work is perfect. James Earl Jones gives such an outstanding vocal performance that even when discussing his career’s biggest role, Darth Vader isn’t the obvious choice. Jeremy Irons and his raspy voice elevate Scar as the villainous character. If you close your eyes and only hear every character’s voice, without having watched the film previously, you can easily identify who’s the “bad guy”, and that’s unbelievably good. Everyone else is amazing, but these two gentlemen are astonishing, and they deserve to be remembered forever as the voices of these iconic roles. Nevertheless, in the end, the two pillars of every movie always matter the most: story and characters. The Lion King has an especially compelling screenplay, one that teaches its viewers how to handle loss, but also how to grow up and overcome our worst fears. It’s true that most people cry watching this film, but those same people are filled with joy by the end because they accompanied Simba’s journey. From being a reckless and innocent cub to becoming the king that everyone needed, while also making his father extremely proud. Even though it’s a very tragic movie, Timon and Pumbaa are two hilarious characters that keep bringing some sense of happiness by delivering some well-needed laughs. Their laid-back lifestyle is something that everyone desires, but when you have responsibilities, you can’t just hide from them. You must learn how to be what everyone needs you to be, without losing the essence of who you are. It’s a masterpiece! It doesn’t matter if it’s an animated film. It doesn’t matter if it was “made for kids”. People need to stop looking at animated flicks as something juvenile that only children can watch while parents can do something else. If parents watched this kind of inspirational animated movies as well, maybe the world would be a better place. The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time, and it’s undeniably one of Disney’s best original movies. From the gorgeous animation to the beautiful score, from the emotionally compelling story to the life journey Simba goes through, from the chill-inducing tearful moments to the loud laughs … The Lion King is just perfect. Hopefully, its “live-action” remake will keep its essence and deliver these feelings once again.

It is told in two parts - the first sees a son ""Simba"" born to the king ""Mufasa""; a curious little fella who, alongside his friend ""Nala"" is inquisitive and mischievous - a real pain in the neck to the king\'s major-domo ""Zazu"". One fan the new cub really doesn\'t have, however, is the king\'s rather unimpressed brother ""Scar"" who hatches a plan to depose his brother and take over the kingdom. He manages to achieve exactly this and to get the youngster to blame himself and head off, alone, into exile. The second part is much more fun; he falls in with a warthog and is soon eating colourful grubs and living a peaceful, jolly life far from home. That idyllic existence is not to last long, however - ""Nala"" discovers he is still alive and races to alert him of the disaster that has befallen the kingdom under the rule of his uncle and his trusty band of hyenas. The musical numbers help it build to a gripping denouement, with clever, quite witty dialogue from some good - though not great - voice talents from the likes of James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg to keep the pot boiling.

Le Trou (The Hole) is directed by Jacques Becker and adapted to screenplay by Becker, Jose Giovani and Jean Aurel from Giovani’s own novel. It stars Michel Constantin, Jean Keraudy, Philippe Leroy, Raymond Meunier, Marc Michel and Jean-Paul Coquelin. Jacques Becker’s last film before he would pass away shortly after the film’s completion, is a tightly wound prison procedural that deals in grim realism and claustrophobic sparsity. There’s no prison movie clichés here, there’s no sadistic prison staff, no Mr. Big who is in with the wardens and demands money with menace, and no rapists hovering about the place to seize by force and break the last inch of spirit of the victim, this is as pure and unfussily raw as it gets. Based on a real escape attempt at La Sante Prison in 1947, story has four men in a cell plotting to escape via digging a hole in their cell. When construction work within the prison means a number of prisoners have to be relocated, the four men are a bit perturbed to find they have another inmate thrust into their already overcrowded cell. While of course there’s the small matter of the escape attempt that’s planned, will they be able to trust the newcomer? Will he join in and help? Pertinent questions hang heavy in the sweaty air. Once Claude Gaspard (Michel) arrives in the cell, the narrative initially operates on a cat and mouse basis as the men sound out the newcomer. There’s no histrionics, no threats of violence, an enforcement of machismo to intimidate the new cellmate, just human interaction with viable concerns. Much of these passages pulse with atmosphere as the men talk in hushed tones, or just exchange glances, and then once an accord is reached, all parties are comfortable with each other, it’s time to put the escape plan into action. What follows is quite simply engrossing suspense as Becker deals in long takes of silence punctuated by animal strength as the men pound on concrete with metal. The camera stays static, filming as if in real time, the sound department ramp up the volume to splinter the ears. We observe as the men fashion devices to aid their escape and to remain undetected, some of it genius in its simplicity. And all the while there is the feeling of trust, a bond between the incarcerated males, where the two lead off men are entrusted to go out and beyond the bowels of the prison, working tirelessly in charting the course through a maze of murky masonry, and to then return back to “HQ” for some rest and updates of the progress… The use of non professional actors works brilliantly, adding further realism to the story, with one of them, Jean Keraudy, a bona fide prisoner from the actual event back in 1947. There’s no music here, it isn’t needed to emphasise or manipulate a scene, none more so with the denouement, a closure of some emotional magnitude, and once again it’s without histrionics, and once again it works brilliantly. 9/10', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 43), ('Thriller', 42), ('Crime', 34), ('Action', 29), ('Other', 111)]}, {'writer': 'Steve', 'score': '80%', 'review': ""This week's Noir of the Week is Le Trou (1960) directed by Jacques Becker. The film was called The Night Watch when released in the US in 1960. The 2 ½ hour prison escape film, like Rififi, utilizes long, unbroken, often dialogue-free shots to dramatize the simple story of a group of prisoners attempting an ambitious escape from prison. Le Trou is shot in black and white and is totally without soundtrack music until the very end. The film begins with one of the escapees, now outside the Santé Prison walls introducing the story. The film then flashes back to the Paris prison in 1947. We’re then introduced to a young man Claude Gaspard. He’s put into a very small cell with four other inmates. There he meets the charming, always smiling Volsselin, nicknamed Monseigneur. Also in the cell are fellow inmates Roland Darbant, the man who introduced the film, Geo Cassid, and Manu Borelli. The men work in their cell assembling cardboard boxes. Gaspard finds out that the men in his cell all eat well from care packages from the outside and all are close friends. What he doesn’t realize is that the men are working on escaping. While picking up a care package filled with bread, butter, saugage, smoked fish and rice pudding, the men discuss whether the should tell the new guy about their prison escape plans. They eventually take Gaspard into their confidence and being the long task of breaking the floor. Slowly, in real time, the men chip away at the concrete floor that leads to a sewer tunnel. The film lacks most prison film clichés. There are no sadistic prison guards, and all the prisoners seem like regular guys. Director Becker, who died shortly after the film was completed, used unprofessional actors including Jean Keraudy who was an actual participant in the escape attempt in 1947. Given the film takes place in only three days, the sense of overwhelming tenacity shown by the prisoners is an astounding piece of filmmaking. The film has a number of memorable scenes, including the noisy breaking of the concrete floor with one of the bed legs –in real time- while another prisoner looks out the peep hole using a spy glass made from a tooth brush and a broken piece of mirror. Watching the scene draws you in an even makes you feel like a participant in the hacking, sawing and picking. I won’t give away the ending or any of the interesting plot twists, but let’s just say there’s a heart-breaking double cross involved in a very un-Hollywood finish. Young Gaspard has to bear the brunt of an ironic plot-twist at the end. The film is a great prison escape film not to be mistaken for the French New Wave happening at the same time.

Last year’s “Avengers: Infinity War” set the stage for the highly-anticipated conclusion; “Avengers: End Game” and at long last it has arrived. Picking up shortly after the events of the last film, the Avengers must deal with the aftermath of what Thanos has done. The team is naturally divided between wanting revenge, wanting to set things right, and just wanting to take what they have and go on. As time passes and they struggle to accept the reality of their situation; an unexpected individual returns and with them comes the seeds of a new plan to make things right. Naturally Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is skeptical but eventually warms to the possibilities of the idea thanks to a new scientific breakthrough that makes it possible. Inspired, Tony sets out to put an elaborate plan in motion that will allow the team to try to fix things and to stop Thanos once and for all. What follows is an extended and at times nostalgic heist where various members of the team work to assemble the pieces needed for the plan as they believe they only have one chance to make things right. The film is essentially three acts in one. The first deals with the recap and expansion of their situation and the planning. The second act is basically a heist where action and comedy are blended with some touching moments. This all leads to the final act which is the FX laden set piece where the ensemble cast gathers to fight the forces of evil in a battle to save the Universe.\nThe film is epic in scale and length as it clocks in at over three hours but the movie is filled with so much content that the time goes by quickly and you have a hard time believing three hours have elapsed. It is also a difficult film to review as you cannot recap elements of the film in any great detail without giving away elements that are sure to delight the fans. Suffice it to say that my only real issue with the fil and it was minor; was that it took a while to get to the action but at least there was plenty to keep you entertained along the way. As this phase of the Marvel Film Universe winds down and plans are put in place for the next five years; “Avengers: End Game” is a satisfying conclusion to the epic saga that was started many years ago and weaves elements of many of the past Marvel films into an entertaining tale which features all of the best elements that have made the series of films such big hits. 4.5 stars out of 5', 'most_watched_genres': [('Other', None)]}, {'writer': 'Gimly', 'score': '90%', 'review': ""Hey, so, just some really quick thoughts I wanna get down, 'cause it's after 1 o'clock in the morning, and I wanna get some sleep so I can wake up well rested to seeEndgameagain. Putting it out there right from the get-go,Avengers: Endgameis my favourite MCU movie. It's my favourite movie of the year too, but I've only seen like ten or so 2019 releases, and this is the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so that seems far and away the bigger deal. I can't say it's perfect, there's some conflicting stuff within its own runtime that really doesn't seem to gel (though a re-watch may prove me wrong on that), and it's not like every moment was the no-holds-barred-zero-exception best version of that moment from start to end. But God I loved this thing. I will say this though, the reason that I loved it, is this thing is fan service galore. If you do not care for the franchise's 21 movies preceding this point, thenEndgameis not the movie to turn you around on that. That may come in a future installment, but this one is a culmination. It's the end ofInfinity Warbut also Phase 3, but also a wrap-up and genuine ode to/send off for everything that Marvel has done over the past 11 years. That to me was incredible, and I am eternally greatful, but I cannot imagine it working for people who have no vested interest in these characters. To me though? My first 9 out of 10 rating inthree years. Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can’t stop thinking about it."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Thriller', 37), ('Horror', 36), ('Action', 30), ('Adventure', 29), ('Other', 136)]}, {'writer': 'Manuel São Bento', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :) Don\'t worry. This is going to be a pretty vague review. Right now, as I\'m writing this sentence, I\'m still processing what I saw and how am I going to explain how I felt without spoiling a single tiny thing. First of all, it\'s such a mix of feelings. On one hand, I\'m extremely happy that I was lucky to be alive during this epic time and that I was able to follow these characters that I love and care about so much. On the other hand, I\'m obviously sad that it finally reached the end of this (hopefully) first incredible saga. There are no perfect films and one with so many heroes will always have struggles balancing it all (Infinity War already had this issue). However, the Russo brothers did everything they could to deliver a phenomenal story, and they did. I don\'t think this could have been any better. Its last hour exceeds any expectations. It\'s epic, emotional, action-heavy, and it has one of my favorite shots in the entire history of cinema. It\'s pure magic, and the VFX team will surely get an Oscar for it. The action reminded me of the biggest Lord of the Rings\' battles, and it was impeccably filmed, filled with riveting and chill-inducing sequences. Nevertheless, don\'t expect this high-intensity feeling throughout the whole runtime. The other two acts are a slow-burn build-up to a payoff that\'s going to make you pretty much either ""love"" or ""like"" this movie. I absolutely love it! This is easily one of the best MCU films, if not my new number one. I can\'t deny that the 3-hour runtime has some unnecessary scenes, but even if they don\'t have a significant impact on the plot or even in the characters, they still contribute to the enormous build-up. Seeing this family that we grew up with just talking with each other or having lunch, at the same time that they deal with the consequences of Thanos\' snap, is inexplicably captivating and heartwarming. Characters like Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) and Steve (Chris Evans) supporting each other is simply beautiful. Their comradery and chemistry are worthy of some tears here and there. Some people didn\'t really enjoy Infinity War so much due to the lack of screentime that some characters had. This time around, there are fewer characters to work with, so the balance is better. Everyone gets an important role, from Captain America to Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) to Nebula (Karen Gillan), and even Rocket (Bradley Cooper). Every single character has a major moment. If you take one out of the movie, it just doesn\'t work anymore. This is not only great work from the directors, but also from the writers. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are not even going to be remembered because fans will always think of the cast first. Most of them will also remember the directors. But the writers?! If I stand at the door of the theater at the end of the film and question everyone about who are the writers, I strongly believe most of the audience won\'t know. Every dialogue, every sentence, every word carries so much impact on the narrative. Literally, I cried and got chills just by hearing two freaking words with the perfect timing in between. The amount of grief that the words of the ones who\'ve lost everyone and everything carry is palpable and, for me, those are the most emotional moments of the movie: seeing how everyone is suffering from their own losses, not the deaths themselves. The humor is mostly on-point, but it\'s still connected to my only real issue with the film, which is the second act\'s tone. From the moment the team decides what to do, we already know that this is a 1 in 14 million chance of success like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) said, so the stakes and pressure are massive! With this level of tension, I didn\'t expect such an “easygoing” and “funny” vibe throughout, except for one particular sequence. They do a great job once again of pairing up certain Avengers together, but most of them go through these too comedic plot points for such a crucial and serious mission. Fortunately, this act carries enough action and emotional drive to make this problem not that big of an issue. Visually, this is arguably the best-looking superhero film ever. From the mind-blowing visual effects to the gorgeous cinematography, everything is perfect. The costumes are gritty and muddy when our heroes are in a battle, their faces are all filled with blood, and I have no words to describe how jaw-dropping that last act is. I can\'t wait to change my desktop wallpaper once THAT shot is available. I dropped a single tear just by looking at it. No one talks, no one does anything. It\'s just an amazingly beautiful image. The score is epic as hell. So much that I\'m listening to it right now as I\'m writing this review, and I\'m getting chills all over my body. I can\'t really write much more, to be honest. I will acknowledge the cast because they are brilliant. Each and every single member delivers an outstanding performance, but if I had to choose the ones that both surprised me and had the most impact on me, they would be Johansson\'s, Evans\', and Robert Downey Jr\'s (Tony Stark / Iron Man). “New” characters like Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) blend seamlessly, and the payoff is unbelievably satisfying. In terms of predictability, it goes more or less as I expected, but it still carries a few surprises throughout. Nothing is ever like we imagine or theorize about, so expect the unexpected, and don\'t judge a movie by if it fits your crazy, unrealistic theories that never crossed the producers and directors\' minds in the first place! All in all, I don\'t know what to do now. The only thing I\'m sure of is that I want to see it again, as soon as possible. The last hour is f*cking insane. I couldn\'t fall asleep properly because I couldn\'t stop thinking about it. Endgame surpasses all expectations. It\'s everything I wished for and so much more. I could easily spend a whole day at the movie theater and watch three sessions in a row. It\'s that good. One of the best comic-book films of all-time, without a single doubt. Thank you to Kevin Feige and everyone who worked hard to bring the MCU to where it stands now. I can\'t even think of how are they going to produce something at the level of Infinity Saga. Maybe they never will. Maybe we\'ll have to wait another decade or two for something like this. Until then, see you at the next Endgame screening! Enjoy! Oh and #DontSpoilTheEndgame! PS: it\'s not a perfect movie, I know. It doesn\'t exist one. Yes, Endgame has some issues regarding its pacing and tone, but I would be lying to myself if this isn\'t everything I dreamed of. I felt the same way with Civil War, regarding the rating to give, and I ended up giving it an A after a first viewing. As soon as I watched the second time, I changed it to an A+. I don’t need to wait for that second viewing with Endgame … And thank you to my audience for being incredibly respectful. No yelling, no crazy laughs, no stupid people doing stupid stuff. Thank you so much for not ruining one of the best cinematic experiences of my life!

For most movies I just wait until they come out on disk (preferably Ultra HD Blu-ray if it’s available) and watch them on my home theater rig. So this weekend me and the kids went to the theater to watch Avengers: Endgame. I have to say that it was better, even much better, than I feared. I really feared that the SJW retards at Marvel would take this opportunity to completely re-organize the Marvel universe to their liking. Like how they completely ruined both professor Xavier and Wolverine in that abysmal Logan movie. Luckily, this did not really happen. Maybe the financial reality of their failing SJW comics and Disney doing a bit of culling of the most extreme of the Marvel retards, the ones who fail to understand that super hero movies are meant to entertain and not be their personal agenda channel, are starting to take effect. It was actually a quite good movie with plenty of action, some humor and, of course, lots and lots of special effects. Even the story made somewhat sense, at least in the context of a Marvel movie, even though the writers resorted to time travel. The movie starts of somewhat dark and grim but I guess that was to be suspected. It cheered up as it moved along and then ending … well to me at least it was mostly satisfactory. I was not too thrilled about the “new” Hulk although I warmed up to him a bit during the film. Thor? The less that is said about him the better actually. The rest of the merry bunch was in pretty good shape and I am quite happy that we did not get to see to much of Quill’s usual shenanigans. I really hate that character. I was quite positively surprised at the huge and quite cool battle towards the end. I was thinking, or rather hoping,  that at some time they were just going to reverse Thanos’ crap and that would be it but instead we get to watch another huge confrontation with pretty much everyone involved at the end. Very cool action and FX indeed. There were some silly plot holes of course. As always when writers resort to time travel. An obvious one would of course be that, when they knew they only had enough Pym particles to complete one trip for each person why did they just not go back in time to get more the first thing they did? Especially since they later did exactly that. Also, Captain Marvel (in her new SJW hairdo) flies through a barrage of fire, smashes through Thanos’ ship like it was nothing and then struggles to combat Thanos himself? There were a bit of this silliness spread around but not too much for me to be bothered by it. There were a few casualties of which I am saddened by two of them. I think at least one of them was unnecessary and probably agenda based. I also strongly disliked the rubbish with Captain America at the end. He has never been one of my favorite characters so I do not really care much about him being around or not but that rubbish sob-scene where he hands over his shield to a “politically correct” person was really unnecessary. I guess it must have been put there to appease the Marvel SJW retards. Anyway, my bottom line is that I was greatly entertained by this movie. It had all the good stuff, real super heroes, action, special effects and not too much of the crap that has been spewing out of Marvel the last years.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Action', 61), ('Adventure', 51), ('Science Fiction', 36), ('Comedy', 28), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'swapnake', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'Awesome!', 'most_watched_genres': [('Science Fiction', 1), ('Action', 1), ('Adventure', 1), ('Other', None)]}, {'writer': 'Wuchak', 'score': '60%', 'review': 'How can they possibly save half of all living beings in the Universe?

It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in ""Infinity War"" weren’t just a dream): magic or time travel. All I’ll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of ""Back to the Future II"" (1989). “Endgame” (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing. It starts to get lethargic about an hour in, but perks up with the three teams trying to apprehend the Infinity Stones so they can maybe reverse what happened at the end of the previous film. Everything naturally leads to a huge battle in the last hour that I found boring, not to mention that the epilogue tended to drag on with too much of it being tedious. Still, there are lots of worthy bits throughout, like the opening, the unpredictable first encounter with Thanos, Thor getting flabby, the moving match between Black Widow and Hawkeye at the cliff’s edge, and much more. Unfortunately, the myriad protagonists work against the film because it can’t concentrate on any one or two characters for very long. Captain Marvel is short shifted and decidedly dull.

In fact, there were only a couple of absolute cringe moments and each dealt with Brie Larson, particularly her appearance in the final fight. Thankfully though, Marvel showed a lot of restraint with that and as a result the movie really belonged to the characters that we all have invested over a decade of love and loyalty in....and honestly that was a relief. There were times where the film looked like it wanted to go the other way, and put the OG Avengers in the backseat. So, credit for not doing that. It feels a lot more like Kill Bill 2 in atmosphere than a real Super-Hero movie, all the really fun big fights were reserved for the first film and what's left is a long closing act that is more concerned with tying up loose ends than delivering on over-the-top action. And it works for a send off film after a decade of investment. So what you have feels very much like an intimate and sentimental film made by old friends at send off...or a funeral...but in either case it is absolutely appropriate. Unfortunately, you have the enormously epic CGI battle at the end and I, for one, am kind of done with that trope. It's starting to bore me now, and, honestly, I would prefer something a little more authentic. But, that being said, the film at least called for it. We've seen battles like that before, Black Panther, Aquaman, Infinity War, Lord of the Rings, and, honestly those CGI armies lack any real intimacy. So the end is kind of a bore compared to the rest of the film. The highlight in the film would be Thor with Hulk coming in as a close second. They steal the show from the moment they are introduced and the trademark MCU humor that Black Panther and Captain Marvel utterly lacked. And the humor was a source of comfort after two films that made vague threats of taking themselves far too seriously for a superhero flick. The wrap-up was more than satisfying if not heart-wrenching at moments making it a great send off for a decade of time and money invested in the characters, however the legacy that the MCU is passing on seems in trouble nonetheless and we can only hope that it doesn't go the route that the MCU has been teasing and toying with and continues to deliver fun superhero movies and not the heavy-handed or deadly serious films they have threatened the audience with."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 40), ('Comedy', 29), ('Thriller', 27), ('Action', 25), ('Other', 145)]}, {'writer': 'The Movie Mob', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'Avengers: Endgame is a once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece that did the impossible by exceeding sky-high expectations and delivering a proper send-off to a beloved cast of superheroes.

It\'s bleak, grim and repulsive - and all in a great, intentional, cinematographic fashion. The thread centres around the young ""Flyora"" (a superb effort from Aleksey Kravchenko) who is taken from his Belorussian family farm at gunpoint (along with anything it\'s possible to eat) by the invading Nazi troops. What now ensues follows this young man as he escapes his captors, finds an old rifle and determines to join up with the communists who are fighting almost insurmountable odds to thwart their encroaching, heavily armed, foe. What really resonates here is the simplicity of the production. There are no specials effects, no CGI to create many when there are few - it tells the simplest of stories in a manner that is truly brutal at times, then truly evocative at others. Man\'s inhumanity to man and all that - but writ large and depicting an invading army devoid of any semblance of humanity on just about every level. The experiences of this young man are truly horrific, but the presentation here is not especially graphic - though it\'s not for the faint hearted. We are shown what is happening, but Elem Klimov leaves plenty of scope for our own imagination to augment, if that is actually possible, the true grotesqueness of war, of random killings and destruction and all quite possibly exacerbated by the fact that the conquerors had no real idea what they were doing, or why - the film almost imbues them with the characteristics of the wildest of animals who enjoy their regime of torture and malevolence for the sake of it. The ending has a certain degree of vindication about it - but oddly enough it\'s not especially satisfying. The emotional exhaustion of the viewer has long since set in, and the true fate of what I can only really call these uniformed bullies is just, yet somehow inadequate. The film is gently paced, it could almost be a video diary as young ""Flyora"" meets and hides from those he encounters and we share his fears and risks en route.

The price of admission is expensive, there is only one film theater in my city (every time I want to watch a movie on IMAX or Dolby Atmos, it\'s a financial effort and time-consuming) and the worst of all, a whole bunch of films aren\'t released in their original date, especially November/December Oscar-bait movies. Only now I had the opportunity to see Green Book, and I am so mad I wasn\'t able to write its review in 2018 because this is undoubtedly the best comedy-drama of last year and one of the best overall! With the help of a terrific cast, Peter Farrelly and his writing crew (which counts with Vallelonga\'s son, Nick) deliver what I think is the best screenplay of 2018. I can\'t remember the last time I cried of so much laughter in a film. I can\'t remember the last time I did the latter and still got emotional with the dramatic arc. This comedy-drama sent me through a roller coaster of emotions I wasn\'t expecting, at all. I went in anticipating outstanding performances (check) and solely that. Since 2019 has already begun, I\'m watching the Oscar-bait movies with no real hopes of being utterly amazed. However, Green Book completely took me by surprise. I genuinely don\'t know why everyone was so shocked when it won Best Screenplay at the Golden Globe Awards. It possesses such a well-written story, filled with brilliant narratives about the most sensitive subjects. It takes the two main characters and elevates their individual arcs into subplots where you begin and end with two completely different personas. It\'s an extremely relevant film that shows how our world evolved and fought back racism and discrimination, without ever becoming too dark or even dull. It\'s not more of the same, it\'s not another movie produced exclusively to send a social message and catch some Oscar nominations. It\'s a truly captivating story of how two men can change their perspective of another race or even the entire world, by actually spending time with another culture and ignoring preconceived notions. Nevertheless, this well-structured, beautifully-directed and cleverly-written film would be just ""good"" if not for the two incredible actors, who take this movie to a whole other level. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have such compelling chemistry that I wouldn\'t mind watching them interact for two hours on a car trip. Every single car sequence either produces hilarious moments, filled with tearful laughter, or it drastically changes into a more dramatic and emotional tone, subtly touching delicate topics. I knew Mortensen had a humorous side to him, but I never saw this coming! His timing, his expressions, his Italian accent, his body movements, everything about his performance is perfect. He absolutely nailed his part, by giving me the best time I had at a film theater in a long time, and his Oscar nomination is more than fair. He made a 130-min feature movie feel like a short flick. Ali doesn\'t come far behind. Obviously, since Viggo has a funnier role to portray, the audience members might feel that he\'s just there to help his co-star shine, but he does much more than that. Since he brings the drama element to the story, he has a more restrained performance during the first half of the film. However, once Shirley starts getting along with Tony Lip, Ali gradually offers more and more splendid acting moments. He\'s definitely a supporting actor, but God is he a phenomenal one! Linda Cardellini (Dolores Vallelonga), even though she\'s only on-screen for a few minutes spread throughout the runtime, also delivers a great performance. Tony Lip and Dr. Don Shirley have quite distinct personalities, besides being from different races. Each character\'s arc is brilliantly illustrated by Peter Farrelly, who gradually shows how Tony and Don are changing their view of the world and of each other\'s culture. Either through the witty car sequences or through unfortunate and horrible experiences, these two characters carry the audience on a journey of growth. Change in behavior, mindset and preconceived ideas, by sharing their own culture with another. Even though they were born in different countries and lived through distinguished lifestyles, with contrasting quality of life, they eventually start realizing that what they think of the world and everything else might not be entirely right. Technically, Farrelly controls the movie\'s pacing exceptionally well, by making a two-hour-ish film feel like half of it. Remarkably-balanced tone and some great cinematography is showed in a couple of scenes. Consistently-filmed and well-edited, even though the latter has small hiccups here and there. Nevertheless, this isn\'t a film with extraordinary technical attributes, nor it needs them. Farrelly only needed to do ""ok"" with the producing and filming of a standout screenplay to achieve a fantastic result, and that\'s exactly what he did. Finally, regarding the controversy surrounding this movie ... See how easy it is to watch a film without being affected by outside matters which don\'t have a single thing to do with the movie itself? I don\'t care if someone who worked in the film tweeted something wrong today, let alone years ago. I don\'t care if someone misinterprets Viggo Mortensen\'s speech about racism. I don\'t care if the family of Don Shirley doesn\'t like how the movie approaches his way of being or his way of life. I don\'t care if the story isn\'t 100% true, as long as it succeeds in transmitting the vital message it wants to deliver, while actually being a good film. So, please, stop trying to listen to everything everyone says about a movie or the people working on it, especially nowadays, where chaos is easy to create. Green Book surprised the hell out of me and left me speechless in the end. One of the best comedy-dramas I\'ve seen in a long time, one of the best films of 2017 and, by far, the best original screenplay of the last year. Peter Farrelly and his fellow co-writers delivered a seamlessly-written story, filled with wonderful character arcs and with a quite important message to the audiences around the world. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali deliver award-worthy performances, especially the former who shows his incredible comedic timing and dramatic range. Still, the most compelling and emotional scenes come from Ali, and he does not deserve to be forgotten. I thought 2018 was going to be the first year without me giving an A+, but guess what ...

Nevertheless, the way Peter Farrelly and staff go into detail about this social wretchedness embodying the psychological impact it has in the main character makes the film an outstanding one"". The year is 1962, and the film begins inside Copacabana restaurant where we get introduced the imposing personality of Tony Lip, an Italian descendant whose family came from a lower middle class coping with some financial difficulties. The way Viggo Mortensen performs the character is a proper model of then American racism; therefore he attempted to keep them out until the occasion arrived and Don Shirley appeared in his path, offering him a two-month lifetime opportunity. We all need to bear in mind the precise dates because, in real life, it was nearly a year they spent together. Despite his gifted pianist skills and his upper-class status, he was still a victim of the convulsed cultural impact. Both of them, during the film, learn from each other and fight against the unsettling behaviour of determined people. Although it may seem simple, their interaction is one of the primary reasons why it succeeds. Believe it or not, it arouses curiosity, reaches the climax when they finally let them know as they are, and sometimes it results as a plot twister due to the radical temperament change of each actor. It has been ages since I watched such a pleasant film; afterwards, I felt refreshed as though it renewed me. The contextualisation was imperative to build up each one\'s personality; moreover, it was visually dazzling owing to the costumes, the space and the background advertisement of the decade. Comedy is present as well so that you won\'t be missing from genuine laughs. Everything appears to be perfectly balanced, even the role of secondary personages such as Tony\'s wife and the cheeky cards experience. I\'m chuffed to bits! On the whole, the film ""Green Book"" is an exceptional example of the conception of a masterpiece without spending loads of money in production and without creating plenty of trifling scenarios.

Shot in 70mm film, watching the Bluray on a projector or a large-screen television offers one of the most visually stunning cinematic experiences around. There is no dialogue or voiceover, no characters, but the enormous amount of footage is presented here in a way that gives BARAKA a gripping dramatic arc, and it\'s a sequence that, on repeated viewings, increasingly seems the one logical way in which all this could have been edited. With unquenchable anthropological curiosity, Fricke identifies commonalities that link us all. A Japanese mafioso\'s tattoos, for example, are followed immediately by a shot of the same on an indigenous resident of Papua New Guinea. But it\'s not only exotic tribalism. A shot of affluent Japanese schoolgirls looking at the camera is mirrored later by an almost identical shot of low-caste girls in Calcutta. Nonetheless, don\'t expect a mushy call for tolerance; Fricke\'s editing indeed makes a convincing case for appreciating differences, but there is nuance. Fricke\'s occasional use of footage from churches, mosques, temples, etc. is less an advocacy for belief in religion than an extension of the commonalities he identifies. Human beings have an urge for contemplation as solace among the complicated and sometimes senseless world around them, and they draw on inner sources of mercy to go against the cruelty that people show to their fellow man. The consequences of a world cut adrift from calm and compassion are shown during a heartbreaking sequence that ranges from Auschwitz and the Cambodian killing fields to homeless across the globe and teenage prostitutes in a Bangkok nightclub. The footage is accompanied by an array of musical pieces which help to set the mood for each series of shots: minimalist loops form the soundtrack for scenes of industrial production, we hear harsh bagpipes as the camera tours the burning oil fields of Kuwait, and Dead Can Dance\'s ""The Host of Seraphim"" plays during an indictment of poverty worldwide. Some of musicians involved are rather New-Agey and would never have a place in my music listening, but when integrated into the film they are remarkably effective. The 5.1 surround sound excellently balances cinematic effect and faithfulness to the scenes portrayed. I\'ve watched BARAKA many times now, each time discovering many new things and always being moved, whether to pity (Calcutta garbage-pickers) or wonder (the unreal glittering hall of Shiraz\'s Shahcheragh mausoleum). I would certainly rank it among my favourite films. Will you like it? That\'s hard to say. BARAKA is my go-to Bluray when friends and family want to try out my fancy home theatre setup with HD projector and surround sound, and while some of them have been just as stunned as I am, others don\'t really care. Apparently many people, even those with a well-rounded education, don\'t have much curiosity for things outside their own everyday experience, and so Fricke\'s survey of world cultures doesn\'t resonate with them. (Note that while Fricke created a 2011 follow-up called SAMSARA, I would recommend staying away from it, as it is less focused and only repeats BARAKA to diminishing effect.)', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 78), ('Comedy', 27), ('Romance', 22), ('Documentary', 13), ('Other', 53)]}]",76,Pump it up!

And what if there was a group of quasi-spiritual rebels infiltrating The Matrix with the sole purpose of crashing the ruddy great mainframe and rescuing humans from their unknown purgatory? And, hey, what if Keanu Reeves was their Messiah? What sounds like some web freak\'s wet dream is, in fact, a dazzlingly nifty slice of sci-fi cool. The Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry - last seen dabbling in kinky lesbian noir with the excellent Bound) pulling off something like a million masterstrokes all at once. Taking the imprimatur of the video game, they meld the grungy noir of Blade Runner, the hyperkinetic energies of chopsocky, John Woo hardware and grandiose spiritual overtones into William Gibson\'s cyberpunk ethos to produce a new aesthetic for the millennium powered to the thudding beat of techno. And it is just incredible fun. The key is the technique of ""flo-mo"", a process born from Japanese animation, whereby an object in motion is seemingly frozen while the camera miraculously spins around it as if time and gravity are on hold. It grants the action (including some killer kung fu which Reeves and crew spent months perfecting) liberty to take on surreal visual highs. Superhuman feats permissible, of course, in the context of VR as the rebels download Herculean ""talents"" to fuel their subterfuge. Meanwhile, the audience can only gawp longingly, with its jaws thunking to the cinema floor in unison, as the heroes wrapped in skintight leather, sleek shades and designer cheekbones, spin up walls, leap from high rises and slip through streams of bullets in silken slo-mo. Tron this ain\'t. Immediately reigniting the moribund cyberpunk genre (the kids can\'t get enough Stateside), this has thrust Reeves from his imploding career back to Speed highs (and laying to rest the hideous ghost of Johnny Mnemonic) and stolen much more of Star Wars\' thunder than was thought humanly possible. For all its loony plot, The Matrix is fabulous. Sure, the expert Fishburne is depended upon to expound the lion\'s share of the script as seer-like rebel leader Morpheus. Reeves, stunning in his newcast slenderness, as Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson, the hacker turned hope for all mankind (care of some ill-defined mystical calling) is asked little more than perpetual befuddlement.

The focus is on a Captain (Tom Hanks) and his men who are commissioned to find a paratrooper (Matt Damon) whose brothers have been killed in action. No one\'s supposed to say anything bad about SPR. To do so is considered sacrilege, but I have to be honest about what I like and don\'t like about Spielberg\'s popular WWII war flick. The initial beach landing (shot at Curracloe Beach, Ballinesker, Ireland) is outstanding, as is the closing half-hour battle at the crumbling village of Ramelle. In between these two great bookends are a few quality sequences, but I didn\'t find a lot of the drama all that engaging or convincing. The cast is notable (also including Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Vin Diesel, et al.), but the characters never struck me as real for the most part. I\'ve seen the film three times and each time I was too often conscious of the fact that I was watching actors portraying WWII characters in a movie. When you see a truly great picture, by contrast, you completely forget you\'re watching a movie, e.g. the original ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979). Moreover, too many of the situations in SPR, including the dialogue, simply struck me as unreal or annoyingly treacly. Exhibit A is the moronic dog-tag sequence, which was supposed to be emotionally stirring but just made me roll my eyes. But, like I said, no one can criticize SPR and get away with it, even if the criticism is legitimate. It\'s like you\'ll be accused of being un-American or something, which is far from the case with me since I love America; I just can\'t stand the corrupt government & politicians, particularly the loony DemonKKKraps. In light of my criticisms, I simply don\'t get why so many praise SPR as ""the greatest war movie ever made."" Again, the opening and ending battle sequences are great but the dubious dramatics leave quite a bit to be desired. I\'ve heard SPR hailed on the grounds that much of it was taken ""verbatim from first-hand, eye-witness accounts of the real Normandy invasion."" I\'ll take their word for it, but this isn\'t what I object to. I object to the contrived, sappy, questionable way Spielberg depicted the dramatics and the fact that I was unable to buy the characters as real. The aforementioned dog-tag sequence is just one example, others include the French father’s stupefying actions and the forced fight at the radar station and how it’s resolved (ooh, the Captain’s a high school teacher, whoopee). Nevertheless, there IS a lot of good in SPR that makes it worth viewing. You can’t beat the battle sequences, the cast and the convincing WWII visuals throughout.

Indeed, watching it you wonder just how any of the Allied soldiers managed to ever survive the water let alone fight their way up a beach crowded with tank traps, mines and barbed wire - all whilst under constant machine gun fire. Steven Spielberg leaves very little to our imagination and bodies drop left, right and centre with an authenticity that John Williams scores remarkably poignantly. It\'s during this seemingly impossible assault that we are introduced to ""Miller"" (a career-best from Tom Hanks) and his squad who are tasked with taking out one of the heavily defended pill boxes. Meantime, the US Chief of Staff - General George Marshall is informed that one particular lady is about to get three telegrams in one day telling her that her sons have died. There is a fourth - ""James"" - and the reward for ""Miller"" and what\'s left of his group is to find this man and get him home to safety. What\'s also illustrated quite succinctly here is that despite the most meticulous of planning, nobody really has much of a clue who had landed where, who was alive or dead, and whether or not the master plan was working or not! This makes the new task even more difficult as the men, along with the dragooned interpreter ""Upham"" (Jeremy Davis) set of in search of a man they don\'t know with feelings that can only be described as ""mixed"" about the legitimacy of their mission. What now ensues is a potent story of war and of how the pressures and horrors of constant fear and weariness can corrupt the the most decent of souls. We see these men - decent men - turn into things they would never have thought themselves capable of becoming and the acting really rams that home in a characterful and visceral fashion. Brutality and savagery are not limited to the Nazis and again these images are presented to us with an honesty rather from a rose-tinted good v evil viewpoint and the dialogue has a ripeness and vivacity that rings true, too. It\'s not devoid of some black humour as we progress through war-torn France before a denouement that combines edge-of-the-seat drama with splendid cinematography and all of the ghastliness of conflict. The men valued each other as much as anything else, their inter-reliance and their determination to get the job done - even if they didn\'t really know why - is a testament to the attitudes that prevailed throughout the real fighting in Europe during WWII and this dramatisation is stunning.

Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received. In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\'s success is there for all to see. What we do in life echoes in eternity. So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there\'s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel, actually overrides film making irks. Crowe\'s Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life\'s pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny - with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year. Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen\'s turn here against that of Diane Kruger\'s in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that\'s inspiring. I didn\'t know man could build such things. Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men\'s destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap.

From panic attacks to haunting imagery, death looms large throughout the entire film and serves as a menacing villain. The journey our heroes take to confront this fear is very heartwarming and will resonant with most audience members. With most DreamWorks pictures, the comedy is targeted at both children and adults. I did find myself laughing out loud at plenty of jokes, but just as many landed flat for me. This would be more of an issue, but this is an incredibly balanced film with great action and dramatic moments that leave little room for a few flat jokes to make a large impact on my experience.

If there\'s one comment I deeply despise is the ""animated films are for children"". This preconceived notion is extremely dated, and honestly, quite childish. I don\'t even think it works within a teenage banter anymore since anime keeps growing exponentially around the world, and animated movies are reaching more and more people as time goes by. The whole ""you watch cartoons, you\'re a baby"" bullying statement to make friends laugh about someone is now decades-old. However, I still feel a bit of pity for people who believe animation can\'t have the same emotional impact than live-action, especially when a major studio like Pixar is known for making the most grown-up of adults cry like an infant. In addition to this, some viewers think that the latter studio owned by Disney is the only company making decent animated flicks when they\'ve been losing ground to other unbelievably talented people. One of my favorite animated films of all-time is Kubo and the Two Strings, a stop-motion animation work from Laika, the studio that also created Missing Link and Coraline. Cartoon Saloon is emerging as an awards-contender studio, by releasing movies such as Song of the Sea, The Breadwinner, and now Wolfwalkers. The main difference between this last company and the others is the style of animation: the ""old"" 2D animation that 90s kids like me grew up with. That\'s precisely where I\'m starting this review. Wolfwalkers\' 2D animation proves once again that this style will never become ""dated"" or ""less than"" the current 3D design. Don\'t be mistaken, I love both styles! I\'m not part of the whole 2D vs 3D discourse simply because I firmly believe both have their own benefits and limitations. 2D animation brings a sense of uniqueness and artistry to any story due to the distinct drawing from many skilled artists, but it\'s more limited than 3D when it comes to creating an immersive atmosphere and its respective world. However, the latter is becoming stagnated in its design structure since almost every 3D animated flick visually feels and looks the same. So, there\'s no good or bad, right or wrong, better or worse when it comes to animation. I can offer dozens of examples of exceptional, gorgeous-looking, utterly superb animated flicks from both styles, as well as awful, corporate-like films that I try my hardest to forget (looking at you, The Emoji Movie). Fortunately, Wolfwalkers belongs to the first group. Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart direct an emotionally heartwarming tale with seamless execution of every single aspect. Will Collins\' screenplay isn\'t particularly new or innovative though. It follows a somewhat generic, predictable story with key plot points that any viewer with minimum viewing experience will see coming from miles away. However, it\'s a formula that, if executed properly, still delivers a rich, passionate, captivating narrative, which will always please both children and adults. Just from the premise, it\'s pretty clear that the message of the movie is inspired by cliches such as ""don\'t judge people by their cover"" or ""our wants can steal someone else\'s needs"", and it even approaches racial discrimination since the film deals with two different populations. Obviously, having in mind one of these ""societies"" is a pack of wolves, there\'s also a message towards deforestation and excessive animal hunting, leading thousands of species to their eventual extinction. All of these themes are handled brilliantly, and it never feels preachy. It doesn\'t matter how unsurprising the story ends up being when I feel as absorbed by the characters and the animation as I did. Honor Kneafsey and Eva Whittaker, as Robyn Goodfellowe and Mebh Óg MacTíre respectively, display phenomenal voice work, which is then elevated by the stunning, expressive, award-worthy animation. Sean Bean is also terrific as Bill Goodfellowe, Robyn\'s father, who basically possesses the character arc that goes through the significant change of acknowledging, understanding, and accepting an entirely different culture and its people (in this case, animals). Every character is incredibly well-written as are all dialogues, surrounded by a Celtic-inspired atmosphere, myths, and obviously, music. Bruno Coulais and folk group Kíla developed the movie\'s original score, and it\'s undoubtedly one of my favorite soundtracks of 2020, including one of my favorite original songs (""Running with the Wolves"") in one of my favorite musical sequences of the year. ""Favorite"" is definitely the right one-word description of how I feel about Wolfwalkers. It\'s one of those films I can\'t really point out a single flaw. Massive praise to the drawing artists who designed such a fantastic 2D world. Their work is often unappreciated and underrated (besides being underpaid), so I want to offer Cartoon Saloon my biggest thank you, and keep making excellent cinema. I have no doubts: Wolfwalkers is, by far and so far, the best animated feature-film I\'ve seen all year. I know the big gun from Pixar is coming up (Soul), but it will have to be an absolutely perfect movie to surpass Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart\'s beautifully heartwarming Celtic-inspired tale. Cartoon Saloon continues to prove that 2D animation is still capable of delivering emotionally compelling stories through gorgeous-looking, unique, artistic drawings. Despite Will Collins\'s generic narrative and cliche messages, every single detail is executed perfectly, without a single flaw to point out. Outstanding voice work from Honor Kneafsey and Eva Whittaker as the well-written, captivating protagonists. However, it\'s Bruno Coulais and Kíla\'s original score that melts my heart and sends chills down my spine every time I listen to it. One of my favorite films of the year, I\'d be extremely surprised with myself if it doesn\'t end on my Top10. Watch it with your family. It\'s worth it.

Aldo Raine. This was my first taste of the popular director\'s eccentric repertoire, although I\'ve since seen all of his movies. The first time I tried to watch ""Basterds"" I gave up around the 50-minute mark. Don\'t get me wrong, the dialogue-driven opening sequence is great but the film seemed to bog down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation and the accompanying interminable dialogue (mostly in subtitles). I just wasn\'t ready for this because I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WW2 film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of generally subtitled dialogue. I eventually gave it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn\'t some typical war flick. Strangely, the ""interminable dialogue"" pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn\'t hard to follow. The drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose. There ARE elements that bring to mind ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967), including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn\'t kick-in until the final act, but ""Basterds"" is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality. All effective films have quality characters and ""Basterds"" has several: The stunning Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna, the cinema proprietor who quietly seethes with retribution; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Hans Landa, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain who mercilessly hunts down Jews; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but no-nonsense leader of the brutal Basterds; super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress & British spy; and Daniel Brühl as a genial German hero with the hots for the beautiful Shosanna. Like Tarantino’s other great movies (“Pulp Fiction,” “Django Unchained” and “Jackie Brown”), ""Basterds"" pulsates with confidence, style, quirkiness and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the idiotic ""blockbuster"" syndrome that plagues modern cinema with its predictability and overKILL action & CGI, etc. Most movies seem like they’re in a rush and shy away from extended dialogues because they fear losing the viewer’s limited attention whereas Tarantino makes them a highlight because it’s an area where he excels.

Those who are into the world cinema, particularly the Korean, knows Park Chan-wook very well. But if you don't, then you must. His films are definitely for the grown ups. Like everybody else, my admiration for his work has started a decade ago with the film 'Oldboy'. He had tried his luck in Hollywood with 'Stoker'. Despite a good entertainer, it was criticised. I love Park Chan-wook doing hundred masterpieces like this in Korea than trying to do one in Hollywood. His ability to turn the good book into a great flick was phenomenal. Here it goes another one. This was based on the British novel 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters. The story of an orphan woman who assigned to be a maid for a young rich woman who is living under the shadow of her uncle since she has no parents. Yeah, I was expecting it, but I did not think it would be another masterpiece from the director. I even thought the ratings could be exaggerated, and the reviews from his die hard fans like Nolan's or QT's fans does. The timeline of the story was prior to Second World War Korea under the Japan rule. A perfect setting for such theme. The film opened like it is an average film. That's where all I got wrong. Or probably I judged it too soon. The storytelling was split into three parts and the first part was a bit mix of fun and like any film, introduction, the platform for the rest of the narration filled with surprises. The young orphan Sook-hee was recruited by a thief who is planning to trick a young woman named Lady Hideko with all the wealth left behind by her parents. The only obstacle for him is her uncle, a guardian. So Sook-hee becomes close to her. More than she had expected, but their plan is working. Now they have to wait for the perfect moment for a perfect strike. When it arrives, an unexpected twist takes the tale to go back to where the film originally had started. But even further earlier and this time, the perspective of the story was from the Lady Hdeko. ❝So even if my love for you leads me to ruin, don't pity me.❞ So, with that flashback, the second part begins. But literally it was a series of twist, that keep explaining us in another angle of the whole scenario I had witnessed in the previous part. Believe me, I have never seen such a long twist before. I was like unmoved for that entire segment. One of the best things I have ever in a film. The praise must go to the author, but the director and his actors as well did a fine job. There's a twist in every scene. So, for that one must pay close attention to the first part, despite slow moving story. But above all, what I'm surprised was I did not know it was a lesbian film. Moreover, I did not think it could have bold scenes for such theme. Everything seemed perfect. I mean the erotic parts are sensual, but very artistic than unnecessary disturbance. Mainly because of stronger hold of the story narration than anything else. Even the pace picks up, like a crazy speed. Everything about the film you would learn in this section. All the secrets of the past revealed and what might comes are still kept under mysterious for the third and final part. The most awaited, the conclusion part begins forth. For everything we saw so far, what might come after makes this film at its best. Just like the mid part, this is also full of twists. Because it will going to tell who ends where and what they get. Over two hours long film, and every frame are worth. The casting was best and so the setting of the 1930s Korea. Especially I must applaud the filmmaker's effort to turn the original setting from Europe to East Asia. It was great, but still now and then you can see the influence of the original source. I mean western culture, names, architect references which might have come from the book. Not just the lesbian or a love triangle story, but something like a circle of love with deceive and defraud. You can notice that in the film poster with four main characters. So when it has a multiple strings attached, you could expect surprises/twists from each angle and it gives that more the convincingly. Put this into your must see list. This is not the first screen adaptation, but surely the best so far. Now we can expect a European or a Hollywood project in a big scale soon.

The cast here are on fine form, Wilder had wanted to work with Charles Laughton for some time, and it\'s obvious that both parties here are getting the best out of each other. Laughton is a pure delight as Robarts, a sharp tongue, all bluster and cheeky into the bargain, his interplay with Miss Plimsoll (Laughton\'s real life wife Elsa Lanchester) is quality, and it\'s another testament to Wilder\'s genius for putting them together. Tyrone Power, in what would be his last completed film before sadly passing away, is devilishly smart as Vole, whilst Torin Thatcher is great as the gruff prosecution barrister Myers. Yet as good as they all are, they all sit in the shadow of Marlene Dietrich and her turn as Christine Vole, sultry and femme fatalistic, it\'s a sizzling performance that crowns this delightful film. It occurred to me overnight that it\'s probably the closest film that Wilder got to being Hitchcockian, and I\'m pretty sure the big master of suspense himself would have enjoyed this one. It\'s a mystery that is dramatic, it\'s a thriller that is also funny, it\'s pretty much a multi genre classic. 9/10', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 43), ('Thriller', 42), ('Crime', 34), ('Action', 29), ('Other', 111)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '80%', 'review': 'I might be asking for trouble here, but did Charles Laughton ever actually make a bad film?

I know, I know… Spoiler-free? For a movie released in 1980? Well, first of all, there’s always someone who still didn’t watch it. Secondly, as deeper we get into the 21st century, the more the 60s/70s/80s/90s movies are forgotten. And finally, if there’s a movie which I don’t need spoilers to explain how outstanding it is, it’s The Shining. With that said … It has always been one of my favorite horror films ever. It’s not perfect (no film is) and some aspects don’t work as well now as they did 5/10/20 years ago. When it came out, Kubrick’s adaptation of Stephen King’s novel was received with mixed reactions. King himself criticized the movie. However, less than 10 years later, Kubrick’s film was already being reevaluated. Nowadays, it’s considered a cult classic, and it’s easy to understand why. From the countless homages to the hundreds of comedic parodies, The Shining has some of the most memorable lines ever. Just this year, we had It: Chapter Two mimicking Jack Nicholson’s “Here’s Johnny!” scene, for example. And then there’s the mysterious “redrum”… However, the movie’s biggest influence is its technical achievements. I apologize in advance if this review becomes too technical, but it’s impossible not to address the arguably best component of the film. This movie was one of the first to use Steadicam (a camera stabilizer mount which allows for smooth shots, even on irregular surfaces, isolating the operator’s movement), something that became so common that people don’t even praise anymore. Honestly, there are still a bunch of recent movies that have terrible camera work, so I’m one of those who defend that the Steadicam use shouldn’t be taken for granted. Especially how Kubrick did, barely above the floor, which originated the extension “low-mode” that now exists and allows for the operator to easily shoot lower than its waist. With the innovative use of the technical equipment, Kubrick’s delivers a masterclass in framing (composing the visual content of a series of frames as seen from a point of view). So much that it became worthy of studying. Almost every shot in this movie has a visual clue or an underlying theme. If you ever feel bored during your viewing, then you’re (probably) not “watching it right”. You’re not truly thinking about it or looking around the characters. This isn’t a generic horror flick with monsters or demons jump scaring you. It’s heavy on visual storytelling, so if you don’t pay attention, you’re going to reach the film’s climactic and enigmatic ending and feel that you missed something. From the mise-en-scene (arrangement of everything that appears in the framing, hence this French term that means “placing on stage“) having several blood-red colors to the wide shots clearly showing “exit” signs and giving the maze-vibe of the enormous hotel, the imminent danger is visually spread out across the movie. The symmetry/mirroring is absolutely crucial to not only deliver key plot points but to create this sense of reality vs fantasy. From the hotel’s structure and decoration (everything is incredibly symmetric) to the growing use of mirrors (these are heavily used to either literally translate words or to show the descent into madness), Kubrick’s framing is what leaves viewers scratching their heads, still to this date. You’ll always find something new on another viewing. It might be from 1980, but it’s a movie that requires your full attention. Don’t underestimate films from the 20th century like you can’t be surprised by a film “that old” (you’ll be dumbfounded by dozens). If John Alcott’s cinematography is impressive, then what can I write about Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind’s haunting score? Nowadays, scores are more based on creating an emotional impact on specific moments. However, throughout the film and during dialogues, even epic films still have a subtlest approach to these scenes, and the music is either very quiet or completely inexistent. In The Shining, the score is part of the conversation. If a character feels fear or danger is imminent, a simple heartbeat can elevate such a moment. If two characters gradually turn their dialogue into something more violent and aggressive, the music makes sure to accompany that descent into craziness. It’s a perfect horror film’s score. Technically, I’ll stop there because no words will be able to express how mind-blowing Kubrick’s visionary methods are. He’s one of the greatest directors ever, maybe even the most influential. Hopefully, his work will always be remembered and never stop being relevant. Story-wise, The Shining also inspired a whole new generation. Everyone knows and loves the key moments of the film, but it’s the clever exposition that satisfies me. Every piece of information is given through either an incredibly captivating dialogue or visual clues/actions. I watched the 144min version of the film (the European version has 25min less than the American version, and the latter has a final scene at a hospital edited out by Kubrick himself), and pretty much every single scene is intended to mean something. It can be important new information or an update on a previous plot point, but every single sequence has a particular purpose. Jack Nicholson commands the screen with a phenomenal performance, one of his career’s best. His script might be very well-written, but his delivery and commitment to the role are astonishing. He carries one-take, extense dialogues seamlessly. Credit to Kubrick for making a movie with at least 2/3-minute takes, sure, but Nicholson is able to transform a good scene into a fantastic one. Danny Lloyd delivers one of my favorite young performances ever. His voice as Tony is a great accomplishment, and he seems to understand his surroundings, in a way that I never felt like I needed to “go easy” on him because he’s just impeccable. Shelley Duvall, however, is a mixed bag for me. Over-the-top displays were better received at the time, but almost 40 years later, her performance does reach an unbearable level a few times. She’s an amazing counterpart for Nicholson and she stands her own within their dialogues, but when she’s alone or in an emotionally troubled moment, she’s too much to handle. Scatman Crothers doesn’t have that much screentime as Dick Halloran, but he shines every time he has to deliver a line. Some people complain about the slow pacing, but I love how it helps elevate the suspense and building up moments of immense tension. While the ending might be just a tad abrupt, the final image of the film stays with us forever, and after all this time, I still didn’t settle on my own theory. All in all, The Shining might be one of the most accessible classics to new viewers of today to understand why it is, in fact, one of the greatest and most influential horror films of all-time. Stanley Kubrick’s masterclass in framing with his play on symmetry and mirrors is evident, so even if you don’t study the art of filmmaking, it’s clear that these two themes are vital to telling the story. In addition to his framing, his use of the innovative Steadicam and his notable mise-en-scene shaped an entire new generation that never misses a chance of paying homage to his work. Besides the impressive technical achievements, Jack Nicholson delivers a memorably haunting performance. The ending is still mind-blowing after all these years, and new theories keep coming up. While I’ll keep trying to settle on my own interpretation, don’t you dare spend the rest of your life without (re)watching this cult classic.

Now, when comparing The Film to The Book it was based on (generally speaking), one major rule of thumb almost always applies: The Book is better. The Help is no exception. Accordingly, with the novel still so fresh in the back of my mind, separating my mind from the book in order to enjoy the film was an almost impossible task. No matter how hard you try, you just can\'t quit comparing the two, nitpicking every detail and being frustrated with everything they changed. Nevertheless, I was still able to enjoy the film for what it was, though I am glad that I possessed full knowledge of the actual story. The Help tells the story of black domestic servants in 1960\'s Jackson, Mississippi. It focuses on white Miss Eugenia \'Skeeter\' Phelan, and her efforts to give a voice to black maids by writing their stories from their perspective and thus giving them an opportunity to be heard for the first time in their lives. Among the black women, Aibileen and Minny are the two key characters. So let\'s just get the ""bad"" stuff out of the way. One of the elements in the novel that I enjoyed the most was the incredibly delicate bond of trust and understanding that builds up (over an extensive period of time) between Aibileen and Skeeter. It really does take Skeeter a long time before she finally wins Aibileen over and convinces her to share her deepest feelings with a white woman. In the film, this process felt rather rushed, like Aibileen just woke up the next morning and decided to do it. What bothers me about this is not just the fact that (oh, cliché) it was ""better"" in the book, but mostly because the film forgets to underline WHY it took so long. Not only is it much more clearly explained in writing that these black women face an incredible danger in divulging their true feelings about the white women they work for, the film also fails to capture the palpable tension and sense of urgency of the book. These women aren\'t just risking their jobs, they are risking their lives, AND the lives of their loved ones. They\'re in danger just for being seen talking to a white lady. I found this to be a rather big flaw of the film. The film also lacks a lot of the character development I was hoping for. Quite a few character changes were made, so that in the film they all just kind of appear out of nowhere, and more or less seem to go about their business without – again – the big ""why"" of it all. One of the most underexposed characters was a woman named Celia Foote, who is a poor white trash girl who married way out of her league – and because of it, has to face the constant disgrace and condescension from the other stuck-up, ""sophisticated"" white ladies. Celia is just the sweetest, loveliest person in the entire story, and her relationship with her maid Minny is heart warming. The fact that they barely included this in the film is a real shame. OK – if I keep comparing the film to the book, this review will never reach its end. Obviously, there is a lot more I could (and certainly want to) say, but it\'s not really relevant to the effectiveness of this review. So, moving on. At least they got the actors right! Each and every one of them was cast spot-on to their character. Emma Stone is wonderful as Skeeter –capturing her youthful daring and naiveté perfectly. There\'s also something about her voice and attitude that make it clear that this girl is different from her snooty bridge club peers. Viola Davis is the perfect Aibileen – all I kept thinking was, damn, she should have gotten that Oscar. Her performance is very moving and heartfelt. Octavia Spencer did actually win an Oscar for her role as Minny, and it was well deserved. She is exactly as I imagined Minny to be – sassy, smart-mouthed and with an attitude that could render any white woman speechless, even if it means losing her job a dozen times. Celia Foote is played by Jessica Chastain, and I fear I\'m at risk of doubling over in superlatives to describe how perfect she was, so I\'ll just leave it at this. The Evil Witch in this story is Hilly Holbrook, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. I\'m not sure how big of a compliment it is to say that she is very good at playing a snide, cunning racist – so let\'s just say she is a very good actress. Another actress worth mentioning is Allison Janney, who plays the role of Skeeter\'s mother. Though she is not quite like I imagined her the way she was in the book (there we go again...), I always enjoy her performances very much and this one\'s no exception. Oh, and Sissy Spacek plays Hilly\'s mother, and she is a delight to watch. I got the feeling that the director extended her role to a little more than what it was in the book, just to give her more screen time. I don\'t blame him. Overall, the film is properly paced and reasonably well-constructed, though some creative liberties are taken here and there considering the timeline. In comparison to the book, it is a little disappointing, but I can\'t think of a single book-to-film adaptation where this wasn\'t the case. I still rate The Help 8 out of 10, because I think it is an important story to be told and the performances are stellar, but if you have a little more patience, I strongly recommend reading the book instead.(March 2013)', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 62), ('Action', 31), ('Thriller', 28), ('Comedy', 25), ('Other', 104)]}, {'writer': 'Kamurai', 'score': '80%', 'review': ""Great watch, probably won't watch again, and can recommend.

She will write the book, but a selection of women from their Mississippi homes will provide the meat for this literary sandwich. These women are maids who all have stories to tell, but she faces quite a battle convincing them to spill any beans. That’s partly from loyalty, partly from fear and also because they all know that the local community on all sides is disinclined to rock the boat.

Well, it actually has a title, what the Darth Vader theme. And that title is ""The Imperial March"", composed by the great John Williams, whom, as many of you may already know, also composed the theme music for ""Jaws"" - that legendary score simply titled, ""Main Title (Theme From Jaws)"". Now, with that lil\' bit of trivia aside, let us procede with the fabled film currently under review: Star Wars. It had been at a drive-in theater in some small Illinois town or other where my mother, my older brother, and I had spent our weekly ""Movie Date Night"" watching this George Lucas directed cult masterpiece from our car in the parking lot. On the huge outdoor screen, the film appeared to be a silent one, but thanks to an old wire-attached speaker, we were able to hear both the character dialogue and soundtrack loud and clear. We even had ourselves a carful of vittles and snacks - walked back to our vehicle, of course, from the wide-opened cinema\'s briefly distant concession stand. Indeed, it had been a lovely summer evening that July. From the time the film started, with my brother and I following along as our mother sped-read the opening crawl, I began to feel rather antsy, thinking that this movie, the first in a franchise that would soon be world-renowned, was going to be boring, due to its genre being Science Fiction: A respectably likable, but not a passionately lovable genre of mine DURING THAT TIME. I just didn\'t believe I was going to like Star Wars all that much ... But I soon found myself intrigued ... And awed. George Lucas is a man with a phenomenal, and I do mean phenomenal imagination. Apart from his human characters (Han, Luke, Leia, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, among others), the droids: C-3P0, R2-D2, R2-series, and IG-88, not to mention those unusual characters like Jabba the Hutt, Yoda, and Chewbacca, just to name a few, are all creations of Lucas\'s phenomenal imagination. And I was completely in awe of each one of these strange beings. Then there was Vader ... And the evil Emperor ... And the Stormtroopers ... And the Spacecraft ... And the galaxies (I\'ll admit that I am a huge lover of the Universe in all its Celestial glory) ... And the magnificent planets ... The Lightsabers ... And so on. Star Wars is a gorgeously shot space opera; it is truly an epic masterpiece. We enjoyed this film tremendously. And my brother was a die-hard fan from that night onward. He, my brother, had even received for Christmas that year, nearly every Star Wars action figure that my mother could find, including two of the spacecraft: The Millennium Falcon and Star Destroyer. The Death Star space station had too been wrapped beneath our Christmas tree - tagged with his name. It was totally crazy, what the new Star Wars era. Frenzied! But it was great ... Even still, to this day. I don\'t personally know anyone whom has yet to see Star Wars, but that certainly doesn\'t suggest there are still a few people out there who haven\'t. And if you\'re one of the latter, then you should know that this classic space opera comes highly recommended. The entire series is told backwards, so you\'ll definitely want to see Star Wars first, followed by its two sequels: The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi ... In that order. I trust that you\'ll too discover yourself to be a lifelong cult fan in the wake. 😊', 'most_watched_genres': []}, {'writer': 'John Chard', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'A long time ago in a childhood not too far away...

Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it. Back in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day. As the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox\'s historic blockbuster didn\'t run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment. It is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn\'t know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn\'t just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas\' baby. Ultimately, though, it\'s one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it\'s that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it\'s an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 43), ('Thriller', 42), ('Crime', 34), ('Action', 29), ('Other', 111)]}, {'writer': 'gastyny', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'Star Wars (1977) is a true masterpiece of cinema, and is \n  definitely one of the best films ever made.For me Star Wars (1977) is the best movie of all time,tied with The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

You\'re a rat in a maze. US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) travels to an island asylum facility for the criminally insane with his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). Their reason for being at Ashecliff Hospital is to investigate the mysterious disappearance of murderess Rachel Solando. But Teddy has another issue to deal with at Ashecliff, namely a meeting with Andrew Laeddis (Elias Koteas), the man he believes responsible for the death of his wife (Michelle Williams). Nothing is what it seems at the facility though, and the further Teddy & Chuck investigate, the murkier the truths of Ashecliff become. Directed by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is adapted from the best selling novel of the same name written by Dennis Lehane (""Mystic River/Gone Baby Gone""). It finds the talented director getting closer to horror than at any point in his career, it also finds him arguably over cooking his grits. Lehane\'s novel is a page turning lesson in thriller writing, there\'s no need for deep cranial thinking or fill in the blanks like musings. Scorsese has crafted a movie that, whilst both stylish and moody, is far more intricate than it needed to be. From the off we saw reams of amateur reviewers dissecting the film and searching for other worldly cinematic meanings. The truth is, is that they don\'t exist, it is just a great story pinging with psychological twisters. Lehane himself said he felt it was a book he kind of knocked out while in his flow (he undersells himself mind). Scorsese, clearly loving the source to be sure, has crammed too much in for the film to be an across the board winner. Technically accomplished? Without doubt. Depth to the story? You bet. But the reality is that the depth isn\'t enough to sustain all the genre blending atmospherics that is Marty\'s want. One is inclined to feel that he so aware that he is treading on well worn genre ground (spot the homages to film noir, old time horror and Hitchcockian grandeur), that he\'s trying to steer the viewers away from the obviousness on offer. The film is further let down by the second half, where it positively crawls along, something not helped by the fact that the first hour bristles with moody excitement and a promise of clinically executed terror. Anticipation can be a real killer at times... Yet as is normally the way with a professionally assembled Scorsese picture, there\'s still so much to enjoy and moments that ensure it will always be a divisive film in the New Yorker\'s cannon. The cast are mostly great, DiCaprio delivers a stunning performance, one that can only be appreciated once the story has reached the climax. Ruffalo (restrained), Ben Kingsley (shifty) & Max Von Sydow (troubling) all do what is needed and in keeping with the tone of the piece. While the girls - Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson & Williams - have small but crucial parts to play. Then there\'s the supporting characters played by some quality character actors. Koteas is joined by Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levein & John Carroll Lynch. How many of you noticed that we here have a roll call of cinematic serial killers? Edgar Reese, Freddy Krueger, Buffalo Bill and Arthur Lee Allen! (OK, Allen was not proved but ""Zodiac"" the movie lends us to believe it was him). The music used is suitably heart pounding and Robert Richardson\'s photography is on the money, especially within the dimly lit Ashecliff walls (the foreboding Medfield State Hospital for location filming). The costumes also have a nice 50s look to them, our first encounter of Teddy & Chuck sees them splendidly adorned in film noir hats and coats. While Thelma Schoonmaker\'s editing is up to the usual tight standard. It\'s always tricky when great directors are involved, so unsurprisingly we witnessed at the start a difference of opinion with the critics as to how good Shutter Island is? What most agreed on was that the film fluctuates in quality and should have been, given the talent behind and in front of the camera, a much better picture. There\'s also no getting away from the fact that if you have read the book first the impact of the ending is considerably weakened. Personally I feel Scorsese was the wrong director for this particular source, but that\'s me, and be that as it may, he still manages to come out of it in credit with his fans - though even if he just passed gas some of them would proclaim it as a masterpiece... 7.5/10', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 43), ('Thriller', 42), ('Crime', 34), ('Action', 29), ('Other', 111)]}, {'writer': 'FlixxFlyy', 'score': '90%', 'review': 'A US federal Marshal is sent on to investigate a missing patient on an isolated asylum called The Shutter Island.

The lead detective suspects something really fishy going on. ""Shutter Island"" (2010) is like a combination of “The Shawshank Redemption” and “A Beautiful Mind” with a little “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.” Being helmed by Scorsese, it’s a top-notch production with a stellar cast, including the likes of Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow, Michelle Williams, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley. The first three quarters are quite good as a slow-burn eerie investigation with the milieu of post-WW2 America and interesting flashbacks to Dachau Concentration Camp. Unfortunately, the last quarter ruins the movie for me. Don’t get me wrong, the ‘twist’ could’ve been done in a compelling, streamlined way, such as in “The Sixth Sense,” but instead everything’s unnecessarily drawn out. For instance, the final sequence between DiCaprio and Michelle Williams is dreadfully dull. Still, it’s a matter of taste. So, if what I described above intrigues you, give it a watch. Many cinephiles hail it. Fittingly, the title, “Shutter Island,” is an anagram of ""truths and lies"" or ""truths/denials.” The film runs 2 hour, 18 minutes, and was shot mostly in Massachusetts, but some stuff in Los Angeles and northeast of there at Hearst Ranch, San Simeon.

Martin Scorsese dives into the psychological thriller genre with precision, creating an atmosphere that’s equal parts eerie and thought-provoking. Leonardo DiCaprio absolutely nails it as Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal investigating the disappearance of a patient from Ashecliffe Hospital. His performance is raw, vulnerable, and perfectly captures the gradual unraveling of Teddy’s psyche. Mark Ruffalo as his partner Chuck adds a subtle balance to the chaos, making their partnership intriguing to watch. And let’s not forget Ben Kingsley, his calm, enigmatic portrayal of Dr. Cawley gives the film its chilling edge. Visually, the movie is a masterpiece. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is hauntingly beautiful, capturing the oppressive isolation of the island and the labyrinthine corridors of the asylum. The storm scenes are particularly memorable, heightening the tension and pulling you deeper into the mystery. And that score, Scorsese’s choice of music hits all the right notes to amplify the unease and suspense. What sets Shutter Island apart, though, is the narrative. It’s a layered puzzle that keeps you second-guessing everything you see. The twists and revelations are not just there for shock value; they’re carefully woven into the story, making the rewatch value sky-high. That final line, “Which would be worse: to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?”, absolutely gut-wrenching. Thematically, the film explores trauma, guilt, and the fragile nature of reality. It’s a deep dive into the human mind and the lengths we go to protect ourselves from the truth. Whether you see the ending as a tragedy or a twisted form of redemption, Shutter Island challenges you to confront the darker corners of your own understanding. A gripping psychological thriller with stellar performances, masterful direction, and a story that keeps you hooked until the very end.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Thriller', 63), ('Action', 44), ('Horror', 32), ('Drama', 32), ('Other', 102)]}]",100,Yes!

Mel Gibson returned to the director's chair with a bang after exactly a decade. It got six Oscars nominees, so let's wait and see how many awards it grabs. It was the World War II theme, based on a real person and events. It tells the story of an American youngster named Desmond Doss, who joins the army to contribute to his nation. But for his religious point of view, he struggles during the training. After managing to make through, the remaining film focused to reveal his bravery on the battlefield against the Japanese armed forces at Okinawa in a place called Hacsaw Ridge. The story was based on one of the ten commandments. Doss, who strongly believes in that carries the same ideology to the combat zone. But all the initial part of the film reflects why he is very on to it. Especially after a fight with his brother in his childhood, followed by saving a severely injured man in a road accident just before deciding to join the army. So it is like both, a war film, as well as an anti-war theme. Most importantly, it tells us the bravery of a man, like of something Gandhi in the battlefield. He did it in what he had believed, but my perspective differs. I liked the film, as a biopic and the message it delivered. Very entertaining too, but when it comes to Doss' belief, I think it was flawed. In the first place he would have not joined the army if he's true to the commandment. That's the basic rule of the commandment if one wants to adopt it. He was just one of the unique person with such idea and luckily succeeded following it in a hostile situation. Only if you think all his episodes from an atheist perspective, that's how you would feel. One of the major reasons for that is, when he saves his men by letting his enemy die.

First half of the picture details Doss' upbringing, getting to know his family background, his beliefs and the forming of his loving relationship with Dorothy Schutte. Then after Pearl Harbour he enlists in service and we are then witness to boot camp, which comes with the horrors of bullying and ostracization due to Doss refusing to even touch a rifle - let alone use one!

From where a true legend is born. As is a Gibson trademark, the battle scenes are terrifyingly real and bloody as can be, the horrors of war laid bare for dramatic impact. Amongst the carnage, which is magnificently framed in smoky hazes and a landscape obliterated by weaponry, Doss (brilliantly brought to life by Garfield) comes to the fore.

As a Seventh Day Adventist and conscientious objector, his goal was to save lives, not kill, which naturally causes problems with his fellow soldiers; until they observe his bravery in combat. Teresa Palmer is on hand as Doss’ potential babe while Vince Vaughn plays the drill sergeant. Based on a true story and directed by Mel Gibson, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" (2016) is a reverent and compelling WW2 flick that includes the usual training sequences in the first half balanced by intense combat sequences in the second. The unique factor here is that the brave protagonist refuses to use a weapon and is determined to only save lives in the midst of the insanity of war. This is an interesting real-life tale that needs to be told and “Hacksaw Ridge” is a good war movie only marred by laying on the heroics too thick as well as the lack of depth in the peripheral characters, which makes them uninteresting. The latter is in contrast to the outstanding “Platoon” (1986) which featured several well-defined characters. The movie’s about an individual who believes in ABSOLUTE pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that refuses to ever turn to violence, even in response to evil or for the purpose of national defense. He thinks this is supported by the Bible and, specifically, the New Testament, but it isn’t. The Scriptures support LIMITED pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that only resorts to violence when justified. Christ\' instructions to ""turn the cheek"" related to responding to a backhanded slap to the face, which was an insult in that culture. In other words, we could all save ourselves a lot of trouble in life if we learn to ignore the antagonism of various morons who would like to divert our focus and ruin our day. The Old Testament teaches this as well: ""A fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult"" (Proverbs 12:16). So Christ was talking about giving an antagonist a break for the sake of peace in situations of personal offense; he wasn\'t referring to cases of severe criminal acts or defense of one’s nation. For proof, Jesus\' ministry team had a treasury box and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves/murderers in their travels. You see, Christ & his disciples weren’t absolute pacifists. On two occasions, the Messiah got a whip out and chased all the fools out of the Temple – throwing over tables, swinging the whip and yelling. He was a Holy Terror, pure & simple, and this caused the legalistic religious leaders to fear him and plot murder (Mark 11:15-18). Harmless pacifists don\'t inspire fear and provoke murder plots. Moreover, Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are ordained of God for the purpose of punishing criminals, domestic & foreign, who threaten the lives of citizens. This includes the right to execute when appropriate. The majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extremists, like Doss in the movie, who refuse to be balanced with the Scriptures on this matter and insist that violent conflict is never appropriate. They’re wrong. Sometimes it’s necessary, like after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, unprovoked, murdering over 2300 innocents and wounding 1100. The film runs 2 hour, 19 minutes, and was shot in New South Wales, Australia.

This was not the first war film directed by Mel Gibson. He had previously made at least one military-themed film, “We Were Soldiers”, set in Vietnam. However, it is a film that addresses much more human and intimate themes, in my opinion, by following the Doss family, a family from rural Virginia, and the trajectory of one of their children, Desmond. Son of an extraordinarily devout mother, raised an Adventist, Desmond learns as a child to deny violence (the film shows a fight between brothers that could have ended very badly, but in real life it was a fight between Desmond's father and his brother-in-law) and to strictly follow his faith and religion. When the US joins the Allies in World War II, the brothers decide to enlist, but Desmond insists on doing so on his own terms, that is, as a combat rescuer, exempt from the use and carrying of any weapon. Of course, the US military isn't going to take this in the best light. The film exposes itself in a somewhat lengthy way and captures our sympathy very well, but despite many people complaining that the first part of the film is slow and tiring, I felt this more in the prolonged combat scenes, despite understanding what led Gibson to detail them so exhaustively. Still, it is necessary to be frank: they are excellent battle scenes, with rich details and a very accentuated degree of rawness. Unfortunately, the dialogues aren't very good, they sound a bit cliché, and it's annoying to see that in a movie with so many qualities. The film also makes efforts to create a romantic subplot around Desmond's first wife, but things don't go well, and the material is frankly poor. In general, Gibson does a good job of directing, although that won't come as a surprise to the most attentive observer. He already has a number of hits in his filmography and, together with Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper, is one of the actors I most like to see in the director's chair. Until now, I never really considered the value of the actors involved in this project. Some I just don't know very well. Andrew Garfield is an example: I've seen him in other works, but the actor never completely convinced me, so I was very impressed with his work here. Sam Worthington also impressed me very well, although he's an actor I recognize more easily, and I've seen him work well in other films. Hugo Weaving is excellent, and Vince Vaughn also deserves praise. Only Teresa Palmer seems to have more difficulty to disentangling herself from the work at hand, perhaps due to the weak material received. Technically, the film has a lot of good things to look at, starting with the reasonably rigorous way in which Gibson seeks to re-enact the combat and war environment, from the recruiting camp to the field. Unlike many films from his past, where the director trampled on historical truth, he seems to make sincere efforts to respect it here. The visual and special effects are really very good, and the CGI used is truly excellent and gives the film a remarkable realism, especially in the combat scenes. The sets are interesting and the costumes too. I especially liked the old uniform that Weaving wears in a brief scene, given the difference with the uniforms in use at the time. The cinematography takes advantage of all this and more, and the camera moves intelligently, putting us in the fight, making us suffer with those soldiers, and feel what they felt, what Gregson's soundtrack -Williams accentuates even more."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'GenerationofSwine', 'score': '100%', 'review': ""I don't want to say that I dislike Mel Gibson as an actor, I mean he's been in plenty of movies that I love... but like Clint Eastwood, he makes a FAR better director than he ever made an actor.

The film was, in fact, the big winner of the Oscars in its year, with ten nominations and five statuettes (Best Editing, Best Art Direction in Black and White, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director and, the icing on the cake, Best movie). However, if we observe that that year were also nominated for much more memorable films such as “Spartacus” or “Psycho”, it is questionable whether this film really deserved to be considered the best film of the year. The script is based on the difficulties experienced by a simple office worker of a large insurance company from the moment he begins to lend his own apartment to several superiors in the firm, so that they can take their mistresses and girlfriends there. With the situation, he gains a bad reputation among the neighbors and with the landlady, in addition to not being able to go to his own house when he wants and thinks he should, being always limited by the arrangements that he is, from a certain moment, coerced into keeping. , as you progress in the firm thanks to the exchange of favors.

Fred McMurray was also very good in this film, giving us with commitment and great charisma an unpalatable character (a married man, very important in the company, who betrays his wife and will take advantage of the ambition of a minor employee). Without disapproval for the good performance of Sirley MacLaine, who gave life to a fragile young woman who is the main love interest of the protagonist, the film is not especially sympathetic to any element of the female cast. The film has a very pleasant pace and time passes without us noticing it, if we give the story a chance to get involved.

Looking back, it's probably the year that I was introduced to the most great literary works of all my life (especially 'Anthem' by Ayn Rand and 'Nausea' by Jean-Paul Sartre). Included that year in the course's curriculum was Anthony Burgess' dystopian masterwork, 'A Clockwork Orange' (as well as George Orwell's 'Animal Farm'--like Frank Sinatra would have said, 'It was a very good year'). I was mesmerized with it from the instant I noticed the unique approach to language, the 'ultraviolence' and of course, the eternal question of free will, its relationship to good-and-evil, and the can of worms of the myriad of ethical dilemmas that comes to the fore of individual freedom and rights versus that of society at large. The genius of Burgess was being able to put so well and forcibly, yet in such an entertaining way, so many issues that, had most anyone else set forth on the endeavor, would have come up with the type of off-putting, heavy-handed sermon that would never have reached such a literary pinnacle, and been required reading even now, generations later. It hasn't aged or dated a day. Most cinematic observers felt the book unfilmable. Director Kubrick's adaptations work so well, particularly this, '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'The Shining' (even though Stephen King would fervently disagree about the latter) because he, as he did with 'Dr. Strangelove', can so easily both find unforgettable visual metaphors for his ideas and so handily combine humour (an under-recognized trait of his, much more readily associated with say, Sir Alfred Hitchcock) with these heavy and daunting philosophical and intellectual volleys. In the wrong hands (particularly a Stanley Kramer, or his ilk), this could have failed miserably, like typical cinematic treatments of Ayn Rand novels. But this worked triumphantly, and heartily exemplifies one of the greatest directors ever at the apex of his craftsmanship. No self-respecting cinephile can avoid this movie, and I heartily recommend you to read the novel as well, though Kubrick nails it so effectively, reading the novel isn't necessary in the slightest for the film to be enjoyed.

Yes, the language is a futuristic mix of Russian, slang and made-up words that Burgess employed so that the futuristic language employed would never sound dated. He called it Nadsat. By the end of the film, for better or worse, you will understand the language. Note: This may be too detailed for those who have not seen the film, so I advise reading it after a viewing. Alex likes violence, sex, and Beethoven. He is the leader of a gang (droogs) and in the first part of the film we witness a typical evening: beating up an old veck (derelict, tramp); breaking into the house of a writer and beating him up and forcing him to witness the rape of his wife (in the book it is this writer who coins the term “A Clockwork Orange”), then heading back to the Korova Milkbar. We are shown Alex’s home: his parents are a rather dull and passive pair. Alex’s bedroom has all the mod-cons, including a pet snake! He also has a state-of-the-art hi-fi on which he listens to his favourite piece of music – Beethoven’s Ninth. There is dissent in his group’s ranks, to which Alex reacts with violence. However, having asserted his leadership Alex and his droogs go on another evening’s rampage. Alex kills a woman in her house, but is locked in by his vindictive droogs. He is caught and sentenced to 14 years. Two years later, the current Government has promised to do something about the gross prison overcrowding so they employ a new technique that makes the offender feel ill when confronted with violent feelings (the Ludivico Technique). Alex volunteers for the treatment because he will get released after two weeks. After the two weeks of receiving the treatment we witness a debasing example of its efficacy conducted in front of his old prison warders and chaplain – who is opposed to the treatment on the grounds that it removes people’s free will. Alex is released. Going home he finds his belongings have been reclaimed by the state, his snake is dead, and his room has been let to a lodger on two-year’s contract. Homeless and with no belongings he meets two of his old droogs who effect their revenge on him. Bloodied, he stumbles across a house and is taken in by the very writer whose wife he raped – and who has since died, attributed by the writer to the rape. Not recognising Alex at first (because they wore masks) he eventually realises who he has taken in and conspires to exact his revenge and at the same time, with the help of his friends, provide ammunition for those who oppose the Government’s scientific methods of rehabilitating prisoners. Stripped of his ability to defend himself, Alex now has become a victim. That Alex survives this is no surprise to viewers, considering he is narrating the story; having been nearly killed by his previous victim, the Government has to take action to enforce damage limitation – Alex’s treatment must be reversed. His ability to enjoy violence must be restored. It’s difficult to view this film in the present day and understand what caused such furore on its original release. There is brutality and rape, but I have seen far worse in mainstream films and by modern standards these scenes are quite tame – and when looked at in the cold light of day there is more suggestion than depiction. I suppose the fact this film is now available on DVD indicates a shift in what is regarded as “acceptable”. As with all of Stanley Kubrick‘s films, it is a carefully engineered story, the music a mixture of “futuristic” synthesiser courtesy of Walter Carlos (now Wendy Carlos, yes, he had a sex-change) and classical music and “Singin’ in the Rain” – the song Alex sings while the writer’s wife is raped. It is a well-made film, full of satire and messages about the free-will of people versus the rights of others to be protected; about how far the state should go to rehabilitate, questions about is it even rehabilitation, and the religious arguments stirred up concerning the removal of one’s free will. There is satire on political machinations and expediency and the love-hate relationship between the press and those in power, how the press can be a weapon against the Government, and its ally. There is a swipe at the fervent belief that God will always provide the answers provided we are patient and wait. Finally, there is a sideswipe at man’s insistence that Science offers the answer to all things, perhaps the main thrust of the book, and that which gives it its title: “ – The attempt to impose upon man, a creature of growth and capable of sweetness, to ooze juicily at the last round the bearded lips of God, to attempt to impose, I say, laws and conditions appropriate to a mechanical creation, against this I raise my sword-pen —.“ I recommend the film.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Other', None)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': ""This is a truly challenging film that routinely glorifies violence - especially towards women, and offers us a terrifying appraisal of the effects of unfettered government and science working in cahoots with each other. Fifty years on from it's groundbreaking release, it's great to watch this on a big screen again - and though the imagery is much less potent that it was in 1971, the performance from Malcolm McDowell is scarily compelling. The plot centres around him and his three sadistic cohorts who live a disparate life terrorising wherever they roam until finally they go a little too far and he is apprehended. A fourteen year sentence is handed down but after two of them, he seeks enrolment in a controversial, experimental, aversion therapy scheme the results of which don't quite deliver as expected. The film presents us with some some pretty gruesome worst-case scenarios to start with, those serve to exaggerate the threat to normal livelihoods and thus lend credibility to the even more daunting prospect of the clinical conditioning of people. In this case, it is specifically the conditioning of one violent individual, but it's very easy to extend the principle to those with whom the government, or state, might disagree - and Kubrick lays that threat bare for all to see and evaluate. I struggled a bit with the nonsense language at times, it seemed puerile and prone to ridicule, certainly to detract from, the more thought-provoking elements of the plot. Perhaps it is there to serve as steam-valve for the intensity of the subject matter, but I am not convinced it is effective or necessary. The book allows us scope to use our own imagination as to the terror this whole concept could invoke, but as film adaptations go, this one offers us a great and innovative template for any interpretation, and coupled with the powerful use of a classical music score - including Ludwig Van, of course, and a solid supporting cast contributing well, this is a truly momentous piece of cinema."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Romance', 18), ('Other', 113)]}]",100,Yes!

The film, set in the late Middle Ages, begins with a knight returning to his homeland in Sweden after participating in the crusades. When he spots the figure of Death, who has come to get him, he decides to try to gain time by inviting her to play chess: if he wins the game, Death will not take him. What follows is a huge film essay around the themes of death, beliefs, faith, religion and the role of spirituality in human experience. While the plague is raging and claiming victims, we see people increasingly scared, and blindly resorting to faith to protect themselves from what looks like the end of times. We see people's daily lives, with their mistakes, virtues, sins and difficulties. We see the knight himself, with a growing fear of dying and struggling with deeper and deeper doubts about faith, the existence of God. Furthermore, we also see how the Church exploited the fear of death to reinforce its power, influence and relevance within uneducated communities shaken by the epidemic. The ending is simple, but there is a deep meaning in it. Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece seems to have its origins in his own fear of death. Max von Sydow, who gave life to the knight, is the greatest actor present in the film and gives us a strong and impactful performance. The film has gained notoriety over the decades and has become one of the most timeless and culturally significant classics of European cinema. However, it is not a film for everyone. Its simplicity, the way it approaches very complicated and philosophical themes and the ending that is difficult to understand at first glance are more than enough reasons why many people do not like this film, and I have to admit that there is a reason.

The script has been vastly improved upon with updated dialogue just all around better acting than the original. There were not corny lines or interactions that felt awkward. The aerial combat sections are incredible, they are done with such precision and purpose. I could actually understand what was on and where the fighter crafts were in relation to each. These raised the stacks and hade me fully invested. The overall story is pretty great. I loved how the recruits were training for a final ""suicide"" mission, instead of just graduating from the academy. The dynamics between Tom Cruise and his superiors/students were great and felt witty and genuine. The continued relationship with Iceman was touching as they seem to have a real connection that has lasted throughout the years, although I thought his illness and they way they presented it was a bit out of place. My one big complain his Cruises love interest. This plot really has no impact on the story and is just thrown in there for old time sakes. I did enjoy their chemistry together and it was cute to his interactions with daughter. But, I watched the original directly before this and was utterly confused on who she was. It was really odd to have a throw away line in the original be the main love interest in the sequel, but like I said, it did not have a huge impact. The performances are spectacular in this film. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are standouts and their back and forth is really fun to see, delivering some funny jabs but some series dramatic moments. Jon Hamm was great as a hard ass commanding officer. Glen Powell was a standout as well, his cockiness and rivalry with Rooster was great but complex.

Winter. Two horsebacked slave-traders are leading half-a-dozen manacled negro slaves through a large, unspecified section of Texas. As they move one night through a wood, they cross paths with an affable, charming German fellow identified by the hokey model tooth affixed atop his carriage by a spring as a travelling dentist. He greets the traders cordially but he\'s struggling to be understood; not because English is his second language (although he deferentially concedes as much when instructed - more than once - to ""Speak English!"") but because his vocabulary is far wider than that of the simpler men here before him. It\'s not a chance passing, either; this German fellow, who identifies himself as Dr. King Schultz (played by Christoph Waltz with the same smiling, deadly menace that earned him an Oscar statue for his part as Col. Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds) is looking for these traders. More specifically, their inventory of negro slaves. Even more specifically, one of those slaves in particular. Django (Jamie Foxx, Collateral, Ray). Attempting to buy Django, Schultz is met with short, suspicious shrift and ordered at gunpoint to be on his way. Within a second, one trader lies dead and the other lies incapacitated underneath the bulk of his dead horse. Schultz unchains Django, instructs Django to take the dead fellow\'s horse and coat, and pays the remaining trader for all that he\'s taken. He then tosses the manacle key to the other slaves and posits two choices to them, as he sees it: Carry their injured master thirty-plus miles to the nearest town for medical assistance, or unchain themselves, blow the injured slave-trader\'s head off with the gun Shultz has left them, bury the corpses and use the Pole Star to run for the Northern states, where slavery had been abolished, and for more than fifty years in some areas. Funnily enough, they take up the latter option. So begins Django Unchained, an oater set in the slave states of the Deep South and the latest rollercoaster by Gen-X movieland wunderkind Quentin Tarantino. Always clearly a man heavily informed by the grindhouse subgenre of the Spaghetti Western, he\'s finally made one himself, and if Quentin\'s your thing it\'s a blast, though I doubt it\'ll convert many Tarantino sceptics; in fact it\'ll almost certainly reinforce those things that people dislike about him, about which more later. It transpires that Dr. Schultz ISN\'T a dentist (""I haven\'t practised dentistry in five years,"" he confides to Django over a beer) but a bounty hunter, and a lethal one at that. He\'s chasing down the Brittles, a murderous gang of brothers currently plying their trades as plantation overseers. He doesn\'t know what they look like but he knows they were recently employed at the Carrucan plantation, which is why he was searching for Django - a slave recently sold by that very plantation - in the first place; Django can point them out for him. Schultz is no fan of the South\'s backwards-thinking propensity for slavery though, and he offers Django a deal: help Schultz find and kill the Brittle Brothers, Schultz will treat Django like a free man, pay him $75 (a decent little wedge in 1858) and rubber-stamp his freedom. Along the way, he\'ll also teach Django a thing or two about the art of gunfighting and about the macabre trade of bounty-hunting (both in which Django proves to be a natural). On the trail of the Brittles, Schultz wonders aloud as to Django\'s plans once this endeavour is over and he\'s free. Well, as it happens, Django is a married man and his intention, once free, is to find his wife and buy her freedom. They\'d tried to run from the Carrucan plantation together but they\'d been caught, branded (both Django and his wife - played with all of her nerves exposed by Kerry Washington - sport R-For-Runaway scars on their cheeks) and sold on, separately. So he doesn\'t know where she is but that\'s what he\'s going to try to do. Schultz, feeling responsible for Django as the man granting him his freedom, proposes a further deal: If this Brittle bounty goes well, he\'ll honour Django\'s freedom but if Django stays with him through the winter as partners, taking on bounties and earning money, he\'ll help Django locate his wife. What we have here is a large sequence of set-pieces - some funny, some tense, some action-packed - stretched across very-nearly three hours (though, like most QT films, it moves like a bullet train and those three hours just fly) strung together by a fairly simple revenge/rescue tale set against a geographically sprawling backdrop; a reasonably similar template to many of Quentin\'s movies and an almost identical template to that of previous outing Inglourious Basterds, to which Django Unchained could almost be considered a companion piece despite the wildly different global and historical settings. Like Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained is quite a bit longer than the story need be, and like Inglourious Basterds that is because each scene is treated by Tarantino as a mini movie, a contained set-piece all of its own. Every scene is fleshed out and deepened for either heightened comic or dramatic effect by lengthened sequences of characters going about the mundane or by characters delivering enormous monologues - rambling shaggy-dog stories, usually - to one another, for context. Not every scene is entirely necessary, either. I wouldn\'t call that a flaw though, I\'d call it a trait typical of Quentin Tarantino; whether it\'s a flaw or an outright treat depends entirely on whether that\'s an element of Tarantino\'s writing that the viewer appreciates. Personally, I love Tarantino\'s writer\'s voice and I could watch these scenes for hours (indeed, I watched Django Unchained three times over the course of yesterday), but I can fully undersand what those lamenting the decent 90-minute film that\'s lost somewhere within the sojourns and speeches of Django Unchained are saying. Performances throughout are utterly mesmerising, from stars Foxx and Waltz but also - in fact, maybe more so - from principle antagonists Leonardo DiCaprio as ""Monsieur"" Calvin Candie, the horrifying owner of the ""Candyland"" plantation currently holding the ownership deeds on Django\'s wife, and Samuel L. Jackson in an if-anything even more monstrous role as Stephen, Candie\'s elderly head house slave, a man who has utterly abndoned the culture and torment of his people in return for a few material trappings as the slave-in-chief. Playing to superb comedic effect is Don Johnson as Big Daddy, a strutting, peacock-like Tennessee dandy and owner of the plantation currently employing the Brittle Brothers, and delightful in cameo roles are (among many others) James Remar (The Warriors, Dexter), Jonah Hill (Superbad, The Watch), John Jarratt (Wolf Creek, Rogue) and Michael Parks (Red State, Kill Bill). Quentin himself makes a cameo as usual and, as usual, he\'s not as charming as he probably thinks he is, but he\'s also not as bad as many think he is, either. There\'s even a quick cameo (raising an involuntary cheer from me!) by Franco Nero, the original Django from the magnificent 1966 film of the same name by Sergio Corbucci (that\'s not the only nod back to the first Django movie; the opening credits to Django Unchained are presented in exactly the same way as the original, and the theme song to Quentin\'s film comes directly from the Corbucci film too). Django Unchained is likely to come under fire on a couple of counts; possibly for it\'s incredible levels of bloodshed (one particular gunfight is the most blood-splattered scene I\'ve seen in a movie since those elevator doors opened in The Shining), and much more probably for the liberal use of what guilty white folks like to refer to as ""The \'N\'-word"", uttered literally hundreds of times from first scene to last. However, neither criticism is warranted in my humble opinion. The bloodshed is of the overexaggerated cartoon quality. Heads, arteries and extremities explode upon bullet impact like detonated watermelons to a gloopy, ""BLAAAPP!"" sound effect, the blood itself translucent, syrupy and intentionally unrealistic. And if a tale is set against the backdrop of slavery in the 19th century deep South, you\'re going to hear the word ""Nigger"" in that tale. Often. Be assured though that just as Inglourious Basterds was a revenge fantasy of the downtrodden Jewish war refugees over the stupidly evil Nazi Germans, this is a tale of empowerment of the enslaved black man over his sadistic, pig-ignorant white overseers. If you like Tarantino, you\'ll probably like Django Unchained. If you like Westerns (and the blood-drenched Spaghetti Westerns of the late sixties in particular), you\'ll probably like Django Unchained. If, like me, you\'re an admirer of both Tarantino AND westerns, this is a no-brainer. Get and see it, it\'s a blast.

The Dr. King Schultz character (Christop Walz) is incredibly funny without being ridiculous, Jamie Foxx is excellent as Django and Leonardo DiCaprio is doing his role well as a plantation owner and slave trader. None of the rest of the crew stood out as particularly bad. Well with the possible exception of Tarantino himself then when he made his usual in-movie appearance a’ la Hitchcock. Not that he was particularly bad but he is no actor either. The movie starts of by Dr. Schulz liberating Django and proceeding to a small town showing Django what he is in the business of doing. Those first minutes of the movie are somewhat unexpected and very funny to watch. After that the movie gets more serious as Django gets to learn to be a bounty hunter and finally gets on with his quest to rescue his “Damsel in distress”. It still has quite a bit of “Tarantino humour” sprinkled around in it though. During the movie we are treated to a long series of stereotypical people with, let us say, an “attitude” towards African people. It is tempting to say “nigger haters” but that would not be true since a lot of these people did not exactly hate them. They just did not consider African people to be people but more than live stock for them to use as they wished. Unlike a lot of movies portraying these events this one never comes across as boringly finger pointing or overly morally lecturing. Nor does it in any way support or glorify the way things were at this time. It is a movie made to entertain set in a period where bad shit happened and using it for the story. Nothing more and nothing less. As usual with a Tarantino movie there are some violent parts, some more violent parts and some bloody violent parts in it. The ending fights are a glorious show of destruction and blood splatter. I am sure some people are complaining about the “unnecessary violence”. I am not one of those people. Without these parts it would not be a real Tarantino movie. As always it is made with the usual exaggeration that Tarantino is so good and which reminds you that it is “only a movie”.\nThis is one of the few movies that I have given 10 out of 10 stars in a very long time.

Christopher and Jonathan Nolan crafted one of the best films of 2000 based on those facets of the human condition. Their protagonist is Leonard Shelby, played with stupendous believability by Guy Pearce, who is suffering from a memory amnesia caused by a trauma to the head as he tried to aide his wife who was raped and murdered. He can remember things before the incident, but anything post that and he can't form a memory. So who can he trust? Does he know any of the few people who appear to be in his life at the present time? He tattoos his body to help him remember, constantly writes notes to keep him alert in his now alien world, while all the time he is on the search for the man who ruined his life. Christopher Nolan plants the audience right into Leonard's world. By using a reverse story telling structure it's deliberately complex and ingenious given that it opens with the ending! It has been argued that it's trickery for trickery sake, style over substance, but the way each scene is built upon in the narrative is a thing of high quality, it's all relevant and demands the closest of attention from the viewer, where cheekily we are ourselves asked to form memories of prior narrative passages. Mystery is strong throughout, the characters currently in Leonard's life may have different means and motives, it keeps us alert, with the confusion, lies, manipulations, enigmas and amnesia angles booming with neo-noir vibrancy. And the Nolan's know their noir of course, adding a narrator who is hard to define or trust himself! The reverse structure wasn't new in 2000, but Christopher Nolan picks up the idea and adds new strands to it, simultaneously bringing his visual ticks as David Julyan's musical score shifts from elegiac forebodings to pulse pounding dread, and as evidenced by the darling easter egg option that allows one to watch it in chronological order, it's a damn fine thriller without the reverse trickery anyway.

By adding a new twist to traditional conventions, Nolan is able to consume and grip the viewer throughout the entire film and for years after. The aspect that differentiates this neo-noir from its competitors today is its jumbled and complex narrative which continually moves backwards in time. The viewers first see the main character complete his revenge murder (a triumphant scene we usually associate with the ending of film noirs). We then begin to see events unfold backwards and the reason for this becomes clear. Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) and his wife are attacked in their home. His wife is murdered but Guy Pearce is left with a brain condition that disables him from creating anymore short-term memory. Constantly being reminded of the horror of the situation, he is relentlessly spurred on to get his revenge on his wife’s killer. As the viewer progresses through the film, they begin to feel more and more like Lenny. The audience have no idea of what has happened prior to the scene currently showing and so we are left feeling the same confusion as our protagonist. To cope with his condition, he maintains a system of notes, photographs, and tattoos to record information about himself and others, including his wife\'s killer. He is aided in his investigation by ""Teddy"" (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), neither of whom he can really trust (both of the latter actors starred together in ‘The Matrix (1999)’ in which Pantoliano was not to be trusted, disorientating the informed viewer more). The film\'s events unfold in two separate, alternating narratives—one in colour, and the other in black and white. Leonard\'s investigation is depicted in five-minute colour sequences that are in reverse chronological order, however, the short black and white scenes are shown in chronological order and show Leonard on the phone to a mysterious stranger having a conversation that the viewers cannot understand (these sequences are more direct references to the film noir genre that Christopher Nolan is embracing). This style of directing makes the audience completely empathise with Leonard’s situation as you never know more than he does, but also it creates huge comedic and emotional moments which rely heavily on the notion of dramatic irony. With Nolan’s use of handheld camera work, an overtone of pink colouring, and sharp editing (the only transition effects in use are occasional fade outs) the viewer is made to feel disorientated and is therefore able to empathise more with Leonard’s character. The original idea was a short story by Nolan’s brother, Jonathan who also helped with the screenplay. The dialogue in the film is its best feature with its insightful, powerful and heart-wrenching speeches about the nature of memory. As we learn how we rely upon memory for our sense of reality, we begin to question reality itself.  The idea of faith and constant references to the bible can make the entire film a metaphor for people’s faith in Christianity or any other religion at that. ★★★★★', 'most_watched_genres': [('Thriller', 35), ('Drama', 32), ('Comedy', 30), ('Action', 22), ('Other', 135)]}, {'writer': 'AstroNoud', 'score': '80%', 'review': ""Structuring the film in such a way that the viewer knows as little as the protagonist, the Nolan's have created a nifty puzzle that slowly unravels to its climax.8/10"", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 66), ('Thriller', 37), ('Crime', 23), ('Action', 19), ('Other', 101)]}, {'writer': 'r96sk', 'score': '100%', 'review': ""Phenomenal.

Music is by John Ottman and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel. Held in an L.A. interrogation room, Verbal Kint (Spacey) attempts to convince the feds that a mythic crime lord, Keyser Soze, not only exists, but was also responsible for drawing him and his four partners into a multi-million dollar heist that ended with an explosion in San Pedro harbor – leaving few survivors. It sort of sidled into movie theatres in 1995 with no fanfare or heralded notices. Yet it wasn\'t long before word of mouth got around that The Usual Suspects might actually be the must see film of the year. Fledgeling director and writer - Singer and McQuarrie - produce a masterclass of crime/mystery/noir plotting in a whirl of intricate plot shifts and deft sleights of hand. The core essence of the story is simple, just who is Keyser Soze? His reputation is one of utter fear, he may even be the devil himself. What transpires throughout the film is a number of scenes told in flashback form and narrated by Kint as the cops put the heat on him. We are introduced to the five criminals who make up the suspects of the title, where dialogue pings with machismo laced humour. The addition of Postlethwaite\'s Kobayashi character, one of Soze\'s harbinger\'s of doom, further ups the ante of the story\'s deliciously corkscrew intrigue. It all builds to a climax that - has you pondering just what you have watched previously.

The repeat viewings factor still, some decades later, is as strong as ever. The advent of time and home format releases etc have only improved the pic\'s own mythical status. Behind the scenes egos and dislikes on set only add further strength to the characterisations, as does one main man thinking he himself must be Soze when in fact he was way off.

I think it\'s unfair that this movie seems to be so forgotten nowadays, but maybe that\'s because of the intricate plot, loaded with flashbacks. I can understand that, but I think there are even more confusing films out there that have never gone out of style. Anyway, it\'s a quality film, with good actors and a story, to say the least, intriguing. A small note: the film took home both Oscars for which it was nominated (Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor). It all starts when a group of men, apparently random, is taken by the police to participate in a line-up. What seems at first very casual, is not: all of them were criminals well known to the authorities, and most particularly one of them, who was also a policeman and seemed to have retired from crime and to be living an honest life. After this opening scene, the film shows the efforts of the police to capture those responsible for a shooting on a boat, with several dead and a single survivor, who will tell everything that happened. And I say no more because this script is one of those that gets better the less you know in advance. The cast is dominated by two great actors: Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Spacey. Each in their respective character, but both very committed to their work, they steal the public\'s attention whenever they appear, ending up being, in a way, complementary: Spacey gives life to an apparently fragile and sick man who would be the most unlikely suspect, whereas Byrne is the typical ""tough guy"". I don\'t know if I can say that this film is Spacey\'s best so far, maybe that\'s premature, but it\'s safe that his work here opened doors for him to fly higher. Four years later, he would go on to win the Oscar for Best Actor with “American Beauty”. Byrne, on the other hand, is one of those talented actors who never seem to have had their big moment in cinema. I also want to highlight the good work of Pete Postlethwaite, in yet another secondary character of strong relevance, two years after receiving his (only so far) Oscar nomination. Technically, I think it\'s worth praising the direction of Bryan Singer, who stayed true to the suspense and managed to resist the temptation to let the film slip into loud and noisy action scenes that weren\'t really necessary. The best thing about the film is the tense environment it builds, the enigmatic and mysterious way in which it tells its story, and this would have been partly lost if the director filled his film with random shootings and chases. Another point that deserves a note of praise is the soundtrack, and in particular the main theme, used in the opening and end credits, and which is perfectly atmospheric. The rest remains average, but is done without glaring errors.

That being said, I do think that there were some strong aspects to the movie. From a technical standpoint, The Usual Suspects was quite impressive. The camera direction by Bryan Singer was particularly noteworthy, especially given that this was only his second full-length feature film. Where the movie fell short for me was in the writing. While the dialogue and overall story were intriguing, the way they were executed left much to be desired. In particular, the first act of the film was disjointed and difficult to follow. The audience was thrown right into the middle with the suspected criminals, with little information given about their backstories or their connections to one another. As new characters were introduced, the plot became even more complex and convoluted, making it challenging to keep up with all the moving pieces. Once the film starts to conclude the second act, the pieces become a little more streamlined, which makes the back half of the movie much more enjoyable. In terms of acting, the performances were a bit of a mixed bag. Some actors, such as Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne, delivered grounded and impressive performances. However, other characters felt like overacted caricatures of quirky criminals, such as Benicio del Toro\'s character. One of the main selling points of The Usual Suspects is its ""incredible"" twist ending. However, I personally saw it coming from a mile away, which was a bit disappointing. It\'s possible that the film\'s score may improve upon a second viewing, but for now, I can only give it three stars.

After their successful operation, the five are manipulated by the legendary criminal Keyser Söze into taking a much riskier gig. One is captured and he\'s interrogated by the police (Chazz Palminteri & Giancarlo Esposito). The big question is: Who IS Keyser Söze? Pete Postlethwaite is on hand as Söze\'s right-hand man while Suzy Amis plays the babe of one of the thugs. This is a ""twist ending"" flick and, honestly, the film is too reliant on it. The whole movie is just ""wait for the twist,"" it isn\'t actually that entertaining to sit through. In fact, most of the dialog is pretty boring; and only had some value in the end. Moreover, the main characters are just foul-mouthed, tough-guy low-lifes, although Spacey\'s character is somewhat interesting. As such, it\'s next to impossible to care about them. Let \'em all kill each other for all I care. Yes, the ending is clever in some ways, but everything that goes on up to that point isn\'t really worth enduring. As far as the twist goes, I was able to pinpoint the identity of the mystery man down to two people; and I was right. But there are some interesting details to the twist that I doubt anyone could figure out without first knowing the ending and then re-watching the flick. But, after watching, I\'m not interested in seeing it again. The story and the characters aren\'t worth it. The film didn\'t make me care enough to watch again. Filmmakers must understand that, for a movie to be enduring, it has to be about the journey not the destination. And, for me, the convoluted journey in ""The Usual Suspects"" is just dull and laborious. If the characters were worthy and I cared about them I might be more interested, but that\'s not the case. Then there\'s something that I experienced a couple of times while observing the five main guys babble back and forth: I had the overwhelming sense that these were just actors playing \'hip\' tough-tawkin\' hooligans rather than the characters they were supposed to be. This is never a good sign. I can\'t believe the high rating this movie has on IMDb; it\'s seriously overrated. The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area and New York City.

Then later, I figured the story was a total cliché. The villain was that super typical ""misguided"" dude who has a somewhat sad backstory (which is very shortly summarized in passing) and wants to create a utopia world where ""everybody respects each other and laughs with each other"" at the (very miniscule) expense of killing off whoever opposes him on the way. So dumb, so shallow, so déjà vu. But I\'d say even that wasn\'t executed very well, because in some scenes he seems to enjoy just wreaking havoc and/or inflicting pain on others a little too much (which seems rather out of character for someone so dedicated to the idea of universal love and respect). Of course, the good guys win at the end, and the villain gets some ""character development"" in the form of realizing how mistaken he was at the very end. That\'s just... dull. So again, I\'d say this film is okay to watch, but it\'s far from masterpiece.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Fantasy', 1), ('Documentary', 1), ('Action', 1), ('Adventure', 1), ('Other', 1)]}]",100,Yes!

About three hours later we\'re still waiting. Hamilton is divided into two acts. The first covers Hamilton\'s arrival in New York City in 1776, his work as General George Washington\'s aide-de-camp during the American Revolution, and how he met and married Eliza Schuyler. The second covers Hamilton\'s postwar work as the first United States Secretary of the Treasury and his death in a duel with Aaron Burr. The first act is strictly hagiographic; Hamilton is so messianic that Burr (Leslie Odom Jr.) might as well be called Judas. Watching the meteoric rise of the protagonist\'s military and political career unfold in song and dance form, I began to experience a revelation; if they changed the historical pe-riod and characters, this could easily become Forrest Gump: The Musical. We never really get a sense of why Hamilton was so special, important, and essential in the lives of so many people; his success seems to be the result of a geographical-temporal accident — that is to say, Hamilton is always in the right place at the right time. Miranda has allegedly written songs with many adjectives and very few verbs; lyrics that care more about the \'what\' than the \'how\' and \'why\'. ""How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore/And a Scots-man, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot/In the Caribbean by providence impoverished/In squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar?"" That’s a good question, deserving of a better answer than ""by working a lot harder/By being a lot smarter/By being a self-starter."" And, apparently, by being vague as all hell. Hamilton thus moves from one plot point to the next as in a dream, without ever conjuring up a precise image of the cha-racter\'s trajectory. The second act is more specific about Hamilton\'s legacy; the character stops just \'being\' and starts \'doing.\' There is, however, another problem here. The real Hamilton was more a man of words than actions, and his writings must surely be fascinating to the appropriate reader; on the other hand, one doesn’t read him for the sheer entertainment value. To mention just one example, Hamilton helped ratify the United States Constitution by writing 51 of the 85 essays known as The Federalist Papers, which are still used as one of the most important\nreferences for the interpretation of the Constitution. This is almost as impressive as it is boring, and all the hip hop choreography in the world can\'t change the fact that Miranda\'s alleged songs, although true to the spirit of the statesman who inspired them, are devoid of all trace of showmanship. These are long, heavily expository litanies, laden with facts and dates, as if written by a high school student who can’t remember his History otherwise. Meanwhile, King George III of England (Jona-than Groff, who steals the show in his too brief and few appearances) is depicted as a buffoon, but has the catchiest song in the entire production. All of the above notwithstanding, Hamilton\'s biggest flaw is Miranda himself. As a composer he clearly favors quantity over quality, but a performer with authority and presence might have been able, with a superhuman effort, to elevate the author\'s pedestrian material. Miranda is very far from being that performer; his dancing can be generously described as spastic, and his singing is more of an irritating nasal whine, as if he inhaled helium before each number — as opposed to the oxygen for which he visibly gasps as he tries to sing and dance at the same time. Oh, and to be perfectly non-PC, his physical resemblance to the Bumblebee Man from The Simp-sons isn’t very pleasing either. All things considered, Miranda surrounds himself with a wonderful cast; so wonderful indeed that each individual member, as well as the ensemble as a whole, outshines the star, who is exposed as a black hole of charisma and talent that sucks all the joy out of singing and dancing.', 'most_watched_genres': []}, {'writer': 'badelf', 'score': '90%', 'review': 'If you didn\'t know going in, this isn\'t either a film or a TV show.

Two Little Tramps The most amazing thing about Charlie Chaplin’s The Kid is that it was released in January of 1921. That makes this film 100 years old! A century has gone by since it was made, released, and first viewed, and yet it’s still available to be appreciated anew today. The DVD print that I watched was in very good shape, the picture was great, and I felt that I was watching an important piece of cinema history. However, The Kid is by no means one of my favorite Chaplin films. In fact, two out of my top three aren’t even silent films, but prime examples of Chaplin’s later work: Monsieur Verdoux (1947) and Limelight (1952). And my third favorite, the 1936 masterpiece Modern Times, is only two-thirds silent! The plot of the film is quite simple: our beloved Little Tramp finds another little tramp, and and raises the foundling as his own. Years pass, and together, they rise above their life of poverty through the power of love and comedy. “Professionally funny” is a phrase that I thought a fitting description of Chaplin. He was an artistic genius, and he knew what he was doing and how to engage an audience. In fact, this was his first feature-length film, and he took a whopping five-and-a-half months to shoot it, which was an incredible amount of time for a film production in 1921. Chaplin, of course, not only starred, but wrote, directed, produced, and scored the film! Jackie Coogan was fantastic as “the Kid”, displaying a wide range of emotion and deftly tugging at the viewer’s heartstrings. His father, Jack Coogan, Sr., coached his son during filming and was paid $125 a week by Chaplin, and also played several small parts within the movie.\nChaplin and Coogan in The Kid (1921) It is said that Chaplin and Coogan were as close off-screen as on, and every Sunday during the first few weeks of filming, Chaplin would take the boy to the amusement park or other fun activities. This relationship was seen as either an attempt on Chaplin’s part to reclaim his own unhappy childhood, or possibly he was just thinking about his own son whom he had lost, having died three days after birth. The Kid features a truly bizarre dream sequence in which the Tramp falls asleep on his doorstep and dreams of everyone — including himself — as an angel or demon. He envisions himself as an angel, with white, feathery wings spread out behind him, and a harp in his hand. Others, including a neighborhood bully, appear as demons, depicted traditionally in dark (presumably red) attire and horns atop their heads. Even a little dog, suspended on wires, comes floating by in a little angel costume! It’s one of the strangest and most inexplicable dream sequences I’ve seen in a film, and yet it is oddly captivating. The technical aspects in this film — both in the dream sequence and in the rest of the movie — are marvelous when one considers that it was made a hundred years ago, when the movie medium itself was less than thirty years old. Whether or not it is one of Chaplin’s greatest works is up to the individual viewer, but you cannot deny that it is a landmark movie, and holds an important place in the history of American cinema. It deserves a look, maybe even more than one. As the opening title card reads, it’s “a picture with a smile — and perhaps, a tear.”', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 63), ('Comedy', 31), ('Thriller', 21), ('Adventure', 19), ('Other', 125)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '80%', 'review': ""An impoverished woman (Edna Purviance) feels compelled to abandon her child in the hope that he might find a better life - so she leaves him (with a short note) in the back of a car.

Now he's not that keen on children either, but the presence of an attentive policeman means can't just leave his new package in the pram of a woman nearby. Skip on five years and the two have become quite a formidable double act - the lad (Jackie Coogan) chucks stones at windows and his father-figure does the mending!

When the authorities cotton on to the lucrative acts of vandalism of the two, they attempt to seize the kid and put him in an orphanage - and that's when things all start to come to an head.

The space merchant vessel Nostromo receives an unknown transmission as a distress call and land on the moon where the call had come from. Bad idea... Back on release it was one of the most talked about movies of 1979, backed by a  terrifically tantalising trailer - which itself was backed by one of the greatest tag-lines of them all, the weight of expectation of a genre blending classic was colossal. This was only after all director Ridley Scott's second feature length film, could a sophomore pic really be all that? History as we now know has proven that to be the case. On plot synopsis it's standard format, where the haunted house and a killer on the loose has been replaced by a space ship in space. Yet once the pic plays its alien hand, and it becomes a battle of survival in one location, it dawns on you there is really no escape. No running into the garden and down the street, no hiding in the attic hoping the killer saunters off home, this is find and destroy or be destroyed yourself - with the future of mankind depending on the humans to succeed. Some still go into a viewing of Alien nowadays and decry it for being too much of a slow burn, yet this is one of the pic's biggest assets. Time in space is slow anyway, and lonely one would guess, so Scott wisely lets the characters be introduced, lets us understand just enough about their psychological make up before things go belly up (literally as it happens). When the pot finally boils over it's terrifying, the bar well and truly raised for horror/sci-fi hybrid  conventions. With art design by H.R. Giger and Goldsmith producing eerie musical rumbles, the whole piece has a disquiet about it, notably with distressing sexual connotations and symbolism that haunts the mind as the body horror unfolds. The quiet passages are nerve shredders, Alien across the board is a visceral experience, especially for those who have ever watched it on a big screen in a darkened theatre. It made a star of Weaver, who unbeknown to those on first viewing is the main character, another masterstroke by Scott, with Ripley the character in Weaver's hands shunting women's character's in big budget films forward by some considerable margin.

Anyone who knows me already knows that I don't really like alien-themed movies, because I don't strictly believe in intelligent life outside our planet. However, the theme has already yielded many quality horror or thriller films. “Alien” is arguably the best, best-performed, and most enshrined and culturally significant of them all. It's one of those films that has already gone beyond cinematic issues to become a piece of art and culture that we all know, even people who never took the time to see it. Thus, it is not worth wasting time explaining the plot around the “Nostromo”, a cargo ship with seven crew members who are decimated by a highly dangerous and carnivorous alien. The direction, in charge of Ridley Scott, is excellent, meticulous, attentive, and the story is intelligent, very well written and with well-developed and used characters. Contrary to what happens in other films, we see the characters trying to act as a team, and trying to solve an unexpected and dangerous situation. I never felt like they were acting in such a way as to almost purposefully put themselves in danger, which happens a lot in recent horror movies. Sigourney Weaver made an excellent dramatic career after this film, which established her as an actress and opened doors for her in the industry. A deserved reward, given that she puts in her best efforts and gives this character all the resilience, humanity and charisma she deserves and needs.

I had already heard about it, and the good dramatic performance that Al Pacino had, and so I decided it was time to see for myself. Directed by Brian de Palma, it marked its time, but is currently somewhat forgotten. It's understandable: in addition to the gratuitous violence and the crudeness with which it approaches the topic of drug trafficking, we don't have any character here that we are capable of liking, and this puts a wall between the film and the viewer. Brian de Palma is a very solid director. Unfortunately, I didn't see as many of his films as I would have liked: I really liked “Carrie”, which for me is his masterpiece so far, and “Untouchables”. In this film, he did a very competent job, especially from a technical point of view, but the film has no soul and, after a while, it just seems like pure carnage. The chainsaw scene, as well as the final shootout, are worthy of an anthology. Technically, the film is impeccable and has luxurious production touches: the cinematography is beautiful, it highlights the sun and brightness of Florida very well and gives us a real feeling of the tropical climate. The sets and costumes not only fit well into the decade, but also manage to emphasize the characters' sense of nouveau riche and fast ascent. Of course, it's absurdly kitsch, even the soundtrack tells us that! However, we can't expect anything else from characters with no taste, no culture, no education and tons of money to show off! However, I will agree if someone tell me that the film is too long, with some scenes a bit incidental or unbelievable (that scene where Gina, enraged, gives herself sexually to her brother, was a good example). With little effort, about half an hour could have been removed from this film, making it more palatable. The film's script is based on a remake of an original from 1932, which very few people know, and which was made by Howard Hughes. Perhaps the name of this film is slightly inspired by the figure of Al Capone, who had the unflattering nickname of “scarface”. In one of the most notable performances of his career, Al Pacino is histrionic, unpleasant and paranoid to the extreme. The intentional exaggeration may be off-putting, but it seems to be in line with a film where everything is exaggerated. However, I don't consider this to be one of the actor's best, I enjoyed seeing him in other roles.

When Hitchcock went on to do North By Northwest, Stewart reportedly begged Hitchcock for the lead role, but Hitchcock refused, giving the lead to Cary Grant, who was actually four years older than Stewart. But according to a biography of Cary Grant written by Pamela Trescott, the reason Hitchcock wanted Grant instead was simply because they worked well together and had wanted to do another collaboration after the success of To Catch a Thief.  In short, that the lead role for North By Northwest had been intended for Cary Grant, and no one else, right from the beginning.

Are my eyes really brown? Casablanca is one of those films that needs no introduction - or in truth - any more in-depth dissection as to its worth. Over the years it has become one of the most quoted ever pictures (sometimes wrongly), and in reality it\'s arguably more iconic than it is a work of art. Although a truly ""A"" list production for 1942, fact is nobody in and around the film expected it to be anything other than a good piece that will put bums on the seats in the theatres. Solidly received on release and riding in on the wave of the Allies inroads into North Africa, Casablanca steadily overcame the much discussed production troubles (the script was practically rewritten daily) to be where it is now, one of the most loved film\'s of all time. I wouldn\'t mention Paris, it\'s poor salesmanship! So what is it about Casablanca that makes it so cherished and adored by each and every generation?. I just know that each time I view it (yearly) it\'s like falling in love again, each viewing brings a new and emotionally driven fulfilment. Tears flow, sad ones and happy ones, an overriding feeling that romantic idealism isn\'t dead, to which Casablanca becomes my personal myth buster. Thematic redemption brings a joyous reward, even as our daydreams about lost chances and lost loves hangs heavy in and around Rick\'s Café Américain. Everything about Casablanca is right, from the flawless direction (Michael Curtiz) to the iconic music, and of course the magnificent characters that are brought to life by the incredibly tight and effective cast.

Rains is great as the conniving policeman as is Veidt delivering the rather sparse, but no less potent, dialogue perfectly.

Unlike some people, I believe that there are perfect movies. It doesn't happen easily, but they do exist, and I'm pretty sure this is one of them. A classic in its own right, which has withstood the test of time and continues to win sympathies today, it is one of the most outstanding films in American cinema, a work that goes beyond aesthetics, art and culture, and which, over the decades, became part of the collective memory, part of the universal cultural heritage. The film was made in 1942, in the midst of World War II, and its production was conditioned by severe restrictions on the use of raw materials considered important for the American war effort. So many of the sets are recycled, they were used in a number of other Warner films and adapted here. Another direct consequence that the war brought to this film is the huge amount of real refugees that made up the technical team and the extras, and who are deeply emotionally moved in that famous scene where the French anthem, sung with all their lungs, completely drowns out the chorus of German officers while singing a patriotic march. The script brings us a love story: Rick and Ilsa meet and fall in love quickly in Paris. However, after a few days, the arrival of the victorious Germans in the city forces them to flee, and makes her decide to end the romance. Years later, Rick finds himself established with a bar in the city of Casablanca, in a part of Morocco controlled by the Free France, and where many refugees drink, gamble and seek the money necessary to pay the passes and visas that the authorities demand to be able to go to Portugal, a neutral country where they can, if they wish, head to the United States. It is there that the two lovers end up meeting again, in the midst of a plot that also includes a corrupt French officer, a ruthless German officer and two stolen passes, which everyone seems to want. The cast is elegantly led by two of the biggest stars of their time: on the one hand, the heartthrob Humphrey Bogart, with his characteristic voice and pose, impeccable in one of the most complete and powerful works of his career. He knew perfectly how to give his character a pleasant dose of cynicism, self-centeredness and disenchantment. On the other hand, the beautiful and intelligent Ingrid Bergman in one of her life's works. The film also has good performances by several supporting actors, such as Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Conrad Veidt and also Paul Henreid and Claude Rains. Technically, we have great praise for the masterful direction of Michael Curtiz, who had the wisdom to give the film the pace, ambience and elegance it needed to be able to flourish and marvel. With discreet production values \u200b\u200band an effort to contain expenses, the film still never feels cheap, and there's never a moment where we can say that we didn't have money to buy a certain prop, to improve a specific set or costume. The cinematography works very well, and the filming work seems to have been impeccable, with some strategic and well-positioned zooms marking the most dramatic scenes and the juiciest dialogues. The soundtrack doesn't have very resonant themes, but it's impossible to forget “As Time Goes By” after we've seen this film."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}]",100,Yes!

These children don\'t laugh, don\'t cry, and don\'t play. If you put a toy in front of them, they don\'t touch it. They are just numb. There\'s no more childhood in their eyes. After seeing these kids many times, when they started to have a trusting relationship with me, I used to ask them, ""are you happy to be alive?"" Ninety-nine percent of the kids answered ""no"". They told me: ""I\'m not happy to be here."" ""Why am I here when there\'s no one to take care of me?"" ""Why am I here if I\'m going to be hungry all the time?"" They have the feeling that they\'re here because they are being punished for something. Taking as its subject the horrific plight of guttersnipe children in the slums of Beirut,Capharnaümis the kind of film of which a superficial reading might suggest miserablism at best, and ""poverty porn"" at worst. Comparisons to film such as Danny Boyle\'sSlumdog Millionaire(2008), Stephen Daldry\'sTrash(2014), and Sean Baker\'sThe Florida Project(2017) are probably inevitable, albeit not very informative if one wishes to parse the film. Instead, it\'s much more useful to viewCapharnaümin the tradition of classic Italian neorealist pictures such as Luchino Visconti\'sOssessione(1943) andLa Terra Trema(19548), Roberto Rossellini\'sRoma città aperta(1945) andGermania anno zero(1948), and Vittorio De Sica\'sLadri di biciclette(1948) andUmberto D.(1952), albeit far more pessimistic than any of them. The third film from Lebanese writer/actress/director Nadine Labaki (Caramel;Where Do We Go Now?),Capharnaümis written by Labaki, Michelle Keserwany, and Labaki\'s regular writing partner Jihad Hojaily (Georges Khabbaz, Labaki\'s husband, and the film\'s producer and composer, Khaled Mouzanar are credited with ""screenplay collaboration""). Presenting amilieuin which people are utterly discardable, the film depicts children who are literally bought and sold for a few chickens; 11-year-old girls who are married off so their family can afford the rent; babies who are fed on ice cubes covered in sugar; refugees who roam the streets; mental illness which goes untreated; and people without a Lebanese identity card who don\'t officially exist. Uplifting it most certainly is not. In a similar tonal key to Héctor Babenco\'sPixote: a Lei do Mais Fraco(1981) and Walter Salles\'sCentral do Brasil(1998), the film works because it never feels like it\'s exploiting, patronising, or trivialising the poverty and misfortune it depicts, never attempting to manipulate the audience into feeling a preconceived emotion. On the contrary, it\'s matter-of-fact, and notable for just how unsentimental it is. However, it\'s also deeply humanist, with genuine compassion in its DNA and a quiet rage at its core, born partly from an inherent sense of authenticity; shot in the style ofcinéma vérité, it uses non-professional actors whose lives are not dissimilar from the characters they play, with Labaki encouraging improvisation throughout. There are some problems, of course - the framing device of a trial is poorly conceived and distracts from the superior filmmaking surrounding it, the ending is disappointingly didactic, and the litany of hardships endured by the main character does get a little over-the-top. However, this is undeniably impressive filmmaking, as harrowing and angry, as it is solicitous and respectful. Zain El Hajj (Zain Al Rafeea) is a young boy from the slums of Beirut serving a five-year prison sentence for, as he puts it, ""stabbing a son-of-a-bitch."" Neither he nor his parents, mother Souad (Kawsar Al Haddad) and father Selim (Fadi Youssef), know Zain\'s exact age, as he was never officially registered, and therefore has no birth cert. As the film begins, Zain is brought before a judge, as he has decided to sue his parents for bringing him into the world despite not being able to care for their already numerous children. The film then flashes back several months, with Zain working as a delivery boy for the family\'s landlord, Assad (Nour El Husseini). Life is harsh, but Zain and his sister, 11-year-old sister Sahar (Haita ""Cedra"" Izzam), look out for one another. When he sees bloodstains on her underwear, he helps her hide the fact that she has begun her period, believing their parents might try to marry her off. Making plans to escape with her, Zain returns home one day to find his parents in the process of handing Sahar over to Assad. A brutal struggle ensues, but Zain fails to save her, and that night, he runs away. Seeking refuge in a rundown amusement park, he meets Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), an Ethiopian refugee working as a cleaner. Taking pity on Zain, she agrees to let him stay with her in exchange for him looking after her one-year-old son Yonas (an absolutely astounding performance by Boluwatife Treasure Bankole) when she\'s at work. Her forged migrant documents are set to expire soon and as she doesn\'t have enough money to pay her forger, Aspro (Alaa Chouchnieh), for new papers, he is trying to persuade her to sell him Yonas. As time passes, Zain, Rahil, and Yonas form a tight bond, until one day, Rahil doesn\'t return home from work, leaving Zain and Yonas to fend for themselves. Thoroughly uplifting stuff, am I right? Labaki first got the idea for the film when she saw a woman and a one-year-old baby on a traffic island in Beirut. In the film\'s production notes, Labaki writes, the little boy couldn\'t sleep. Every time he would doze off, he would wake up again. And it hit me. The only place where this kid is going to experience life is this half a meter of concrete between two highways. It\'s all he knows. When she got home, she drew a picture of a child shouting at a group of adults, with the caption, I\'m sorry! I quit! I don\'t want to be here! I don\'t belong in your world! I don\'t want to breathe, eat, play, learn, laugh or dream! I don\'t want to grow up to become like you! You have failed me! Brainstorming, she began to write down everything that bothered her about the situation; where did the system fail these kids? Why do we as a society allow this sort of injustice to happen? The migrant workers\' situation in Lebanon; the absurdity of the notion of frontiers; the absurdity that you need a paper to prove that you exist. Looking at the list of topics, she thought of the French word, ""Capharnaüm"" (alternatively spelt Capernaum). The term was originally the name of a Biblical fishing village on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee, which is mentioned multiple times across all four gospels, as a place where Jesus performed several miracles. However, it\'s best known from Matthew 11:23, when Jesus curses the village for its lack of faith in him (""And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day""). Later on, however, the word came to be used in French literature to signify a state of chaos and disorder. The current dictionary definition is, ""a confused jumble; a place marked by a disorderly accumulation of objects"". Beginning to research what life is really like for children of poverty, Labaki went to prisons for minors, refugee camps, courtrooms, and the streets themselves. Shooting with as small a crew as possible, she elected to use a non-professional cast whose lives resembled those of the character they\'re playing (like Rahil, Shiferaw is an illegal Ethiopian immigrant who was working as a cleaner; like Sahar, Izzam was unable to attend school in Lebanon, and was selling gum on the street; like Souad, Haddad has children for whom she has been unable to get ID). In this sense, casting director Jennifer Haddad deserves a great deal of praise, as she\'s done an astounding job of pulling together an authentic ensemble. During the shoot, Labaki would give the performers the basic outline of a scene, but allow them to use their own words and mannerisms, and draw upon their own experiences, without worrying too much about where the scene is supposed to go. With the film being shot in sequence, this necessitated that the script was constantly being rewritten, so as to accommodate something which somebody had improvised. From an aesthetic perspective, Labaki wisely keeps things simple and functional, eschewing any directorial gymnastics, with the aesthetic design perfectly chosen to convey the story she wishes to tell. Adopting a documentarian sense of realism, cinematographer Christopher Aoun sticks to handheld cameras and, for the most part, natural lighting. The scenes on the streets of Beirut are especially impressive, with Labaki shooting most of the material from roughly Zain\'s height, or slightly lower. This allows the scenes to adopt a heavily focalised and subjective view of the world, without having to resort to less elegant POV shots. Chadi Roukoz\'s sound design is also superb in these exterior scenes, with the soundtrack crammed with car horns, shouting, crying, laughter, dogs barking, airplanes flying overhead, traffic on the streets. It\'s an aural overload, conveying how the massive city is overwhelming Zain, and again, tying us to his subjectivity. Laure Gardette (Jeune & Jolie;Frantz) and Konstantin Bock\'s editing is also laudable. Even apart from the fact that they had to cull the film from over 500 hours of footage (the first cut ran 12 hours), with the complete editing process taking over two years, the editing is extremely powerful in certain scenes, with the specific cuts tied closely to the theme and tone of the film. Probably the two best examples are the scene where Zain is trying to prevent his parents from giving Sahar to Assad, and a later scene when Zain leaves Yonas on the side of the road and tries to walk away. The fight for Sahar balances, on the one hand, combinations of shots focusing on Sahar and the parents, and on the other, an equal number of shots focused solely on Zain. This places him front-and-centre in themise en scène, simply by virtue of the fact that we see more of him than any of the other characters. The result is that the scene, although ostensibly concerned with the parents\' choice to give Sahar away, is actually more about Zain\'s reaction to that choice. Similarly, in the scene where he tries to leave Yonas, the editing focuses on him rather than the baby - the shots of Zain are longer, there are more of them, and there are a combination of different framings, whereas all of the shots of Yonas are uniform. This kind of editing is as shrewd as it is subtle, giving Zain a greater sense of agency and energy, and ensuring the audience knows that he, not Yonas, should be the focus of our attention. Labaki sets the tone for the film to come in the very first shot, as we see Zain, filthy dirty, in only his vest and underwear. It is subsequently driven home multiple times that life is almost worthless in this place - Sahar is sold for some chickens, Aspro tries to get Rahil to sell Yonas in return for forged migrant documents, Assad tells Zain, ""I can buy a human for 500"". This is a world in which people think of children in the same way as they think of commodities, with the notion of adults protecting children subservient to that of adults looking at children in a cold transactional manner. In such a place, Zain somehow manages to retain his sense of empathy, although he too is infected with the concept that everything is transactional, as his pragmatism illustrates to him that materialism is the order of the day. However, although he suppresses his sense of compassion, he does not completely extinguish it, nor would he want to. In a world where adults are reprehensible, and children their innocent victims, Zain is the story\'s moral compass, exhibiting a humanity far in excess of any kindness than has ever been shown to him. Thematically, Zain\'s jaded disillusionment, which is far more pronounced than it should ever be in a child his age, echoes the line fromLadri di biciclette, when Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) decries, ""I curse the day I was born."" Zain himself is kind of an amalgamation of Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) from François Truffaut\'sLes quatre cents coups(1959), Huckleberry Finn, and any number of Charles Dickens youngsters (Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, Little Dorrit, Philip Pirrip, aka Pip), with his unique perspective on the world illuminating the horrors of that world in a way that would be impossible were he an adult. An important plot point in relation to Zain is his lack of an ID card. Without being registered when he was born, he can\'t get a state ID, meaning he is effectively a non-person; he cannot own a passport, he cannot legally work, and he is not entitled to an education or medical care, a situation that attains an almost Kafka-esque surrealism in its bureaucratic absurdity. In terms of problems, there are a few. The framing device of the trial, for example, is awkwardly realised, and for the most part, serves only to interrupt the far more compelling story of Zain, Rahil, and Yonas. Additionally, not only do the scenes in court come across as more heavily scripted than everything else, but they also depict something that couldn\'t happen (as Labaki herself has acknowledged, children can\'t sue their parents for giving birth to them). Obviously intended as a means to dramatize how Zain wants a voice, it is nonetheless a narrative contrivance that gets in the way of the far more accomplished filmmaking seen elsewhere. Surrounded by the more naturalistic realism of the rest of the film, the court scenes stand out because they feel like a plot machination. The third act in particular, which focuses primarily on the trial, and which features the usual impassioned speeches you would get in any clichéd courtroom drama, strays into something Labaki has deftly avoid everywhere else; didacticism. Elsewhere, there is something of a sense that Labaki overloads the story, pushing just one too many hardships on Zain, as she attempts to cover a plethora of topics. For example, she touches on domestic violence, the migrant crisis, human trafficking, paedophilia, child labour, education, the justice system, and on occasion, the film feels like it\'s going to collapse under the weight of human suffering and thematic nihilism. This is a shame because some of the best scenes in the film are those involving Zain and Yonas just going about their day, and if Labaki had had the confidence in these quieter moments, she might have scaled back on the socio-political content. In a strange way,Capharnaümhas something of the same thematic DNA as Paul Schrader\'sFirst Reformed(2017), with both films examining the morality of bringing children into a world of suffering (albeit from fundamentally different perspectives, with Schrader\'s examination far more existential than Labaki\'s practical workaday world). Never feeling exploitative, nor glorifying the poverty at its centre, the film isn\'t even especially sentimental, depicting scenes with a raw matter-of-factness, that were they featured in a Hollywood movie would be in slow-motion, with string music telling us to ""Cry now"". Zain is no saint; he\'s a rough, foul-mouthed thief, but he\'s also the most inherently honourable character in the film. Labaki could easily have used Zain to attempt to elicit unearned pity, but instead, she is far more interested in examining the day-to-day survival of children like him. One of his most salient characterises is his practical-minded solutions to the challenges he faces, and in this, we\'re encouraged to respect how he responds to his situation rather than pity him for being in such a situation in the first place. The film adopts something of the same manner; much like Zain, it\'s tough-minded and practical, and just as his hardened exterior is completely authentic, so too is the film\'s quiet anger. Placing us not just in Zain\'s world, but, crucially, in his subjective interpretation of that world, Labaki draws us to him, allowing us to view the world partly as outraged adults, but also as sharers in his experiences. The conclusion is disappointingly didactic, and the journey there harrowing and exhausting. However, in the last shot, Labaki dares to offer a very cautious bit of optimism, and ultimately, the takeaway is not despair, but compassion. Just as Zain finds a humanity within himself that should be long dead, the film finds a moment of optimism amidst the chaos, and encourages the audience to cling to it.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 53), ('Crime', 34), ('Documentary', 34), ('Mystery', 16), ('Other', 73)]}]",100,Yes!

The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya\'s warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it\'s bones.

However, when the first part of this story was released in 2021, I was sorely disappointed by this tedious, overlong slog that, despite its stunning visuals and cinematography, never really engaged me. Though, for all my disappointment with the initial installment, it can’t begin to compare to my reaction to “Part Two” – an even more tedious, unengaging, overly complicated offering that had me bored by 20 minutes in. I found myself not caring a whit about the characters or their story (which could have used a scorecard to help viewers sort out everything), and even the supposedly superior visuals of this iteration failed to capture my attention or interest. I can only conclude that I must be missing something, given the generally positive reactions and accolades this film and its predecessor have received, but I’m mystified that I haven’t yet figured out what. By all rights, the elements would appear to be in place here to make this picture succeed – a stellar cast, great special effects and the skillful directing of filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, who created such excellent works as “Arrival” (2016) and “Blade Runner 2049” (2017) – but “Part Two,” like its predecessor, just never grabbed me. To be honest, I’m truly surprised that I made it all the way through, considering the nearly constant temptation to want to fast-forward through the egregiously dull sequences (of there were many). From all this, I can only surmise that this film and the one that preceded it were created simply to milk as much box office money as possible out of the source material, despite the fact that the story isn’t captivating enough to live up to that challenge. Indeed, if you’re like me and found the first part boring, you’ll probably find this one even more tiresome and lackluster (I’m certainly glad that I waited for this one to come to streaming and didn’t waste my money on theater ticket prices). And now, as I understand it, another sequel, “Dune: Messiah,” is in pre-production to continue a story that has still yet to reach conclusion after more than five hours of screentime. Be aware that the “Dune” films are far from the quality of other lengthy trilogies like the “Lord of the Rings” and “Dark Knight” series, films that definitely hold viewer interest from start to finish. Instead, “Dune” and “Dune: Part Two” are more like such mind-numbing stand-alone offerings as “Heaven’s Gate” (1980), “Ishtar” (1987) and “Tenet” (2020) than anything of a genuinely epic nature.

It explores what it means to live authentically and the cost of breaking free from comfort and illusion. And honestly, how many movies make you question the nature of your own life?

The character that has existed since 1940, has become so heavy with so many different portrayals, different origins, that it feels impossible for any mortal man alive to impersonate the scattered personalities. It is an insurmountable task for any director to digest it all and still produce one more. Todd Phillips had a crazy challenge. He brought in one of the best actors alive to lift it with him, Joaquin Phoenix. Together, they have built a mass-market masterpiece which is just above the crop. It is appropriately crazy and completely focussed on the central character. The narrator goes close to the shores of that craziness, wets his feet but remains dry to tell this story. It is like those news reporters which go closer to the burning amazon, but it is impossible to step in the fumes. In no way, Joker is telling his story. Instead, his story is told to us and there are pillars of sanity (like the detectives, asylum clerk etc.) which remain steadfast to give a strong anchor to the audience. This dilutes the effect of the film. With the copious amount of material on Joker already, I wished to consider this film as a standalone character study vaguely inspired by the batman universe. But this is not entirely possible. I was forced to think about it on two levels. With Batman and Without Batman. With Batman, The Joker is on the home turf. There have been many renditions of Joker, and Heath Ledger's portrayal is still vivid in my mind. I knew that Arthur here will go on to become someone who is going to say, “\u200eIntroduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos...”. When I was thinking Joker in the context of Batman, I could not keep Ledger's joker too far away. I was searching for a path for Arthur to go from the mentally unstable to the calculating anarchist. I was left searching for that path when the movie ended. To remain as the crown prince of crime, and to justify the title of the greatest adversary of Batman, just mental instability isn't good enough. He needs to be much more intelligent, much more cunning. These traits are often visible early, In the case of Arthur, I could not find that complete foundation upon which the later psyche can stand. This reminded me of Cameron Monaghan's Jerome Valeska. The joker of my understanding is somewhere between the cruelty of Jerome and pitiable delusions of Arthur. Also, the iconic Batman moment was not needed in this. I kept feeling that Joker is trying to stand with the support of Batman's tale as a clutch. A safety net enforced by the producers. On the other hand, if I consider this movie as a standalone tale, then it was a bit more satisfying. There are tearjerker movies where nothing good ever happens with the protagonist. A series of bad lucks, or difficulties keep blocking a normal life. He is most definitely poor, has a sub-optimal family background, has a medical affliction which is unique and provides a foundation of the pity I felt. This is not very far from Rani Mukharjee's Hichki if you only consider the medical condition. Rani's Naina had Tourette syndrome while Joaquin's Arthur suffers from pseudobulbar affect. The setting and genre make the two films vastly different. More often than not, I have noticed these disorders lift a lot of burden from the narrative. In the case of Joker, couple his disorder with usually being in the wrong place at the wrong time, you have a travesty of human life. Add to that, an unstable parent, amplify it with the volatile societal conditions, you have a perfect decoction of what Joker is made of. As a tale of its own, it works. The delivery is great thanks to the spectacular performance. It also helps to increase the awareness of mental health. But when you strip off all the Batman context, it remains a well-acted and averagely written tale. Unfortunately, this is a single film, and I felt it is torn between these two polarising treatments. It wants to find its ground, which it finds. But that ground is far from being sensational. It remains somewhat indecisive. It can not be well soaked in Batman lore like James Gordon's tale, Gotham is. I am considering Gotham because both Gotham and Joker do not feature Batman, but they both have Bruce. Gotham understands its lore and fully embraces it but Joker does not want to. At the same time, as a tale of the psychologically troubled protagonist, Joker tries to play safe with the aim to please audience en-mass. I kept thinking about American Psycho and The Machinist. (Coincidently, both star ex-Batman Christian Bale). Those two take you in the psyche of the protagonist. Those take you inside the burning Amazon and not stand at a safe distance. Joker does not aim to do so. I am not at all qualified to talk about the acting performances. Joaquin Phoenix is in every frame and the way he waltzes between emotions is terrifyingly amazing. The Tai Chi to calm himself down, the menacing stare when finally becomes the Joker, those are chilling. He lives the character to the best of his abilities. Regrettably, he does not have the same level of writing support which Heath Ledger had and so due to no fault of his own, Joaquin could not topple Heath Ledger's portrayal of the crown prince of crime. If I consider Todd Philips's entire resume, this was a genre shift for him. He knew very well that the biggest trump card is Joaquin Phoenix, so he takes no risk. He keeps him in focus, almost always all the setting and cinematography works for him. The only exception being Robert De Niro. Robert is allowed to carry his scenes quite independently. I think Todd Philips relied on both these giants to carry their parts. Sadly, I had gone to a theatre which had a bad print or screen so I think I will have to watch it again sometimes to enjoy the cinematography. I realised, I kept writing a lot and this is already over a thousand words. If you are here and reading still, I must say thank you. To summarise, The Joker worked for me and I enjoyed it, but I would not consider it the best depication of the iconic villain from comic books. The best may yet come."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Other', None)]}, {'writer': 'Sheldon Nylander', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'Okay, this film has already been so widely debated that I’m not sure what I can really add to the conversation. So, I’ll just give my thoughts. “Joker” is a fairly basic character study of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who feels increasingly marginalized by an uncaring and brutal society in Gotham City. To start, the characters, except for Arthur himself, are pretty flat. They seem to have little purpose other than to further Arthur’s story. This includes Thomas Wayne, who in other media is portrayed as a man of many dimensions, wealthy but caring, and instilling these values in his son Bruce. Here, he is portrayed as much more uncaring and elitist. Which gives much less of an impact in the inevitable alley scene we see in everything remotely related to Batman. More on this in a minute. It’s important to the point. Arthur suffers a condition that makes him burst into laughter at inappropriate times. He also has other unspecified mental illnesses. We’re never given the specifics. This is actually a little troubling because of the general depiction of mental illness. It almost seems like they are saying that if someone is mentally ill then they are a ticking time bomb and it’s only a matter of time before they go off. This is not a good look. After a series of events, Arthur begins spiraling downward, but at the same time realizes how much influence he can have over other people, an aspect of the Joker that isn’t often explored. And this is where the characters other than Arthur being rather flat comes into play. There’s more than one indication that we are actually witnessing these events through Arthur’s eyes. And this creates a brilliant depiction of a narcissistic personality. The only character that gets fully fleshed out is Arthur himself, but he can’t or won’t connect with other people to see their depth. As such, we get to see narcissism from the inside, no connection to others and in fact seeing them as pawns in his own schemes. It’s subtle and definitely not in your face, but if you look carefully, the hints are there. Those who fear that ""Joker"" would glorify incel violence or otherwise can rest a little easier, but as I mentioned, the film isn\'t without its troubling portrayals. It does vilify the mentally ill, which creates a whole host of other issues. The movie swings wildly between ""excellent"" and just ""okay,"" and sometimes even ""meh.""

I mean, how couldn\'t it be?! Besides belonging to the superhero genre, DC has been on a streak of great films within its universe, so an isolated installment definitely excites me, especially about one of the evilest villains ever. It\'s by far one of the less comic-book-y flicks of the century. It doesn\'t follow the generic origin story formula, it avoids any cliches associated with the genre, and it\'s the type of movie that\'s becoming more and more rare nowadays. It\'s a character study like we haven\'t seen in a long time. I\'ll simply begin with the person that elevates the entire thing: Joaquin Phoenix. Now, if there\'s something I\'m not going to do is compare his performance with Heath Ledger\'s. That\'s the number one mistake people are going to keep making forever. First of all, The Dark Knight and Joker couldn\'t be more distinct films, even if they belong to the same genre (despite Joker being unique, it\'s still about a famous comic-book villain). Then, despite Phoenix and Ledger portraying the same ""version"" of the clown (crazy, sadistic psychopath), the former is 90% Arthur Fleck while the latter is 100% Joker, throughout each of their movies. Finally, Phoenix is the sole protagonist of this feature, while Ledger had the best live-action Batman sharing the spotlight. In conclusion, it\'s both unfair, and a bit unreasonable to compare both interpretations since their roles have a different impact on the narrative, as well as each film being entirely different. In the end, both are impressive. However, let\'s switch to Phoenix since he\'s the star of this show … He has 2019\'s best performance, by far! With a strong marketing campaign, I\'m sure he\'ll get that Oscar. I hope so! It\'s so well-deserved. Todd Phillips and Scott Silver developed a brilliant screenplay, but Phoenix elevates it to a whole other level. Throughout the entire runtime, I felt weird. Perturbed. Even uncomfortable with what I was watching and consequently feeling. It\'s a dark, brutal, violent, emotionally powerful origin of a villain who I feel disturbingly empathetic towards. Phoenix makes the story work due to its remarkably captivating display of someone who\'s mentally ill. Arthur Fleck slowly becoming crazier is due to how society behaves and not due to some chemical pool that transforms his skin white and hair green (nothing wrong with this, but I know which origin story I prefer). ""The world is getting crazier out there"", and it becomes excruciatingly painful to deal with it, especially when so much is going on with Arthur’s personal life, and most of it he doesn\'t even realize because he tries to hide everything behind a smile. It\'s a screenplay filled with narrative twists that not only pack a punch of surprise but leave you feeling extremely upset. The last act is one of the best in the last few years. If the second act is an enormous build-up, the last one is a terrific payoff. I can\'t remember the last movie I saw where I loved 100% every single narrative decision. I wouldn\'t do any of the big moments differently. There are so many excellent references hidden in plain sight that comic-book fans (and fans of the TDK trilogy as well) will love just like I did. In the ending, there\'s one pivotal moment in particular that serves as the absolute climax … I got chills all over my body. They couldn\'t have done that scene more perfect. I only have one tiny nitpick with the way some scenes feel repetitive since they neither move the plot forward or give us anything new. Some of these still help to create tension, some feel like they\'re just… there. A Best Picture and Best Actor nominations seem to be on its way, but these are not the only achievements that deserve to be recognized. The original score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is incredibly addictive, so much that I\'m listening to it while writing this review. It definitely helps to generate tremendous build-up, and it elevates the sinister environment of Gotham City. Lawrence Sher\'s cinematography is utterly stunning. The underexposure of some scenes is glorious. Sher paints the screen with so many gorgeous shots, especially with his close-ups on Phoenix, where the latter is able to shine. Jeff Groth is also impeccable in the editing room. There are several long takes with Phoenix just giving his all and letting all his emotions out (or keeping them all contained), which is always something I deeply appreciate since it helps with the flow of the narrative. Regarding the film\'s controversy surrounding its messages and the incentive to violence, I really don\'t know what to say. It\'s ridiculous. I remember those times when going into the movie theater was a surreal experience. It was the number one place for people to forget about their lives, jobs, everything. Joker is a fictional story! It\'s the origin of one of the worst psychopaths in the history of comic-books and cinema. If people expected to leave the theater ""happy"" or ""joyful"", then at least one of the film\'s message is right: society really is getting crazier. Have people forgotten who Joker is? What could you possibly expect from his origin story?! Nowadays, no one knows how to behave (social media is the primary source for spreading hate). No one respects the fellow citizen or even the world itself. More and more people only look at their own bellies. Political agendas are everywhere. New extreme movements are created every other year. Social hypersensibility is exponentially growing. The same way some people will hate this movie for not being able (or simply not wanting) to accept that they feel empathy towards a murderer, people all around the world behave like their actions don\'t reflect on another person\'s life and on their own planet. If people get ruthlessly violent because they watched Joker, how can someone complain that the film\'s message is bad when it\'s eventually true? All in all, Joker is one of the best movies of the year, and it\'s definitely on my Top3 at the date of this review. Joaquin Phoenix delivers my favorite male performance of 2019, by elevating a script about the origin of one of the evilest villains ever. The way he gradually becomes more insane is worthy of study, but it\'s how he\'s able to make the audience create empathy towards a psychopath that leaves me disturbingly captivated. Todd Phillips produces a character-study filled with an astonishingly tense build-up and one of the most chill-inducing payoffs of the last few years. With every single narrative decision nailed perfectly, Hildur Guðnadóttir\'s score and Lawrence Sher\'s cinematography stand out. The lack of restraint in showing the unmerciful violence (physical and mental) that society inflicts on one another is what makes us feel unsettled. Because we know it\'s mostly true, and we refuse to accept it. It\'s not a film about the Joker. It\'s a very realistic portrayal of someone (anyone!) who can become someone like him. And it\'s disturbingly brilliant! PS: Robert DeNiro (Murray Franklin) and Zazie Beetz (Sophie Dumond) are also great.

Someone to imagine movie by songs and incorporate their interpretation through music. The cinematography was gorgeous and there’s a handful of shots that has imprinted into my memory. Lawrence Sher does an excellent job off showing the decaying Gotham city and the sewer waste look of the city. Bright neon lights with striking colors that manage to make the most run down of places look pretty. I like how they actually gave Thomas Wayne a character rather than “guy gets shot in alleyway”. He’s portrayed as a ruthless man with blunt ways of saving Gotham City. However he loves his wife and son, so his unforgiving attitude was all for the shake of keeping his loved ones safe. He’s also a massive movie buff where he often goes to watch the classics on the big screen. So it’s an interesting take on the character viewed in somebody’s else perspective. There’s a scene where Arthur goes to watch a comedy standup show to take notes on a comedians act. Every time a joke is told and everyone laughs, his face is frozen in place with an unsure grin while his eyes look around the room wondering why everyone’s laughing, but when the laughter dies down he jumps to live with a delayed laugh. It’s moments like that are simple, yet says a lot about him. Basically showing how disconnected he is with humor and everyone else. Now lets talk about the controversy that's been surrounding this movie: This is one of the most ludicrous controversy in recent memory. The movie will not cause or inspire violence, but shows why violence happens. I mean, there probably has been incidents when somebody committed a horrendous crime because their were influenced by a movie or a game. However, it’s he/she that should be brought into question, not the creators. Maybe this movie could inspire people to think twice about how they treat others. Why not think about the positives? If “Joker” is going to be responsible for violence and mass shootings, then so is every other movie with any form of violence ever. If people really care about how violence is portrayed in movies, then Rob Zombies ‘3 From Hell’ should also receive the same attention. Just imagine ‘Natural Born Killers’ times 100, but I guess it’s not mainstream enough for any of that. And sure, there’s some brutal and raw approach to violence in ‘Joker’, but we all have seen worst. ‘Deadpool’ is more graphic than this. It's not the directors duty to teach morals to the viewer.

It’s a meaningfully chaotic picture about trying to distil meaning from chaos and it’s a creative success about creative failure. It chronicles the resonant moments in one man’s life and admits that it can’t quite clarify why they matter. Doing justice to its early working title of The Beautiful Confusion, 8½ is a daring high wire act and an outstanding technical achievement that channels its story of artistic crisis into something sweepingly, uniquely profound. Working again under Fellini’s direction after his winning performance in La Dolce Vita, Marcello Mastroianni plays Guido, a creatively blocked director feeling constantly distracted from the development of his latest semi-autobiographical work. Between avoiding his mistress (Sandra Milo) and disappointing his wife (Anouk Aimée), Guido spends time reflecting on his past, searching for answers and escaping into fantasies. The narrative seamlessly weaves in and out of Guido’s dreams and memories, to the point that it becomes impossible to distinguish real from imagined. The actress named Claudia, tellingly played by the legendary Claudia Cardinale, seems especially intangible, generally appearing only fleetingly in Guido’s visions playing the woman in his film that Guido intends to be a symbol of purity, innocence and redemption. The story, in a sense, is a mess but a brilliantly orchestrated mess that skilfully highlights the mysteries and confusions of life and the human psyche. Characters suddenly enter the narrative then leave before you’ve even noticed they’re gone because the film is confined within the periphery of Guido’s life. What these supporting players actually do isn’t as important as the impressions that they make. They’re all just additions to the fabric of the filmmaker’s mind. This perception of the world is completely in tune with the engrossingly complex lead’s own self-involved view, seeing everyone he crosses paths with as a supporting player in his existence, rather than a fully-rounded individual with a long, complicated life of their own. Guido lacks awareness of the emotional impact of his actions and underestimates his own transparency, not realising when people detect his deceptions and cowardly evasions. His wife, Luisa, in particular seems more observant of Guido’s fraudulent nature than even Guido. It’s made abundantly clear from the film’s choice of protagonist and its title (8½ being Fellini’s count of the number of films he’d made so far) that this film was meant to be viewed at least in part as a very personal work from the director. But if the weary half-heartedness of Guido’s filmmaking is meant to reflect Fellini’s own exhaustion, it’s evident that the director had got his groove back by the time shooting began. Every shot seems perfectly placed and every cut is perfectly timed for the film to fold out with effortless cohesion, like one extended monologue. Fellini hardly wastes a square inch of a single frame, saturating (but not over-saturating) his backgrounds with rhythmic movement and entrancing production design. His thoughtfully precise camera creates inexhaustible space, extending rooms by their mirrors and constructing distinct layers to the crowded environments he observes. This may well be the best directed film of Fellini’s celebrated career. 8½ remains one of those rare feats of cinema that have proved highly influential (acclaimed descendants from recent years include Charlie Kaufman’s Synecdoche, New York and Paolo Sorrentino’s The Great Beauty) and yet still wholly unique. Even Fellini himself never made another work that so gracefully blended irony with sincerity, surreality with relatability and ambiguity with insightfulness, but once was enough. This richly intricate film is built to be endlessly re-seen, enjoyed and puzzled over. The final paradox of 8½ is that it refutes itself. Apparently when a great director doesn’t know what kind of film he wants to make, he makes a masterpiece.

I'm not a fan or deep connoisseur of Italian cinema, but I've heard of Federico Fellini, and I know that this film is considered one of this director's best films. I haven't seen any of his films yet: this was the first. And honestly, I don't quite understand this fascination: the film is chaotic! I think that, unless someone is an expert in cinema, the vast majority of people who saw the film did not understand it, but then said that it was very good just to avoid being criticized. I'm glad I don't give a damn what other people think of me... Fellini was out of great ideas, and the production started working without even having an idea of what the director was going to do. Not even he knew! He was about to give up when the light came: to make a somewhat autobiographical film about a filmmaker in crisis, who had to make a film due to studio commitments, but didn't know what film he wanted to make. Let's face it: it was an excellent idea, even if it resulted in a film that is too complicated and disjointed. Over the course of more than two hours, we see scenes and situations in which the director reflected a lot about himself in the main character: the complicated issues with a restrictive and judgmental Catholic faith, strong moral conflicts, a rebellious childhood, the omnipresence of impactful female figures (the mother, the wife, the objects of desire)… everything is composed as a delirium of a filmmaker empty of ideas. For the time, this was quite innovative, but looking closely today, it doesn't make much sense and is more tiring than interesting. Technically, the film is excellent. The soundtrack, by Nino Rota, is quite atmospheric; the cinematography, with the framing, the differences in shot and sharpness, is an authentic lesson taught by a master. The choice of filming locations and sets is careful. Marcello Mastroianni and Claudia Cardinale are the most notable actors in the film, but they both have better works and I don't feel that this film is worth seeing because of them. But what really tired me was the artificiality of the dubbed dialogues: Fellini liked to film with noise (he's like that college students who like to study in crowded cafeterias), and the actors often improvised their lines over a sketch that was given at this moment, so all the dialogues were dubbed and arranged in post-production. The result is surreally strange and fake, with the movement of the mouth not matching what we are hearing. Yes, this is one of the great works of Italian cinema, that's for sure, and when we see these points analyzed we can understand it better. But it is not the type of film that the general public wants to see, and it ended up being left to an intellectualist and hermetic elite, who like to treat cinema as their thing, with an almost mystical sort of knowledge that cannot be passed on to any mortal.

This film is still relevant in these times, as social media, and other such technological & society advancements have brought about a new degradation of values, with many wanting their fifteen minutes of fame by any means necessary, which now brings with it many who sell their souls to attain notoriety. I love De Niro's performance as Travis, its one that has many facets to it, in it is a man who is angry, naive, sleep deprived, lonely, a sociopath, and a killer. A scene in the Presidential campaign office where he is rebuffed by Betsy due to the terrible date experience, and ushered, and menaced by the opportunistic & snotty campaign co-worker Tom (Brooks), shows the range of De Niro's performance as he goes from apologetic, and sheepish to angry, and ready to fight. De Niro was nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award for this role.

The film breaks down neatly into two very different parts, though both are seen through the eyes of young United States marine J. T. ""Joker"" Davis (Matthew Modine). In the first act, Davis makes his way through Marine basic training with a motley group of other recruits under the hellish command of gunnery sergeant Hartmann (R. Lee Ermey). Joker watches as Hartmann bullies an overweight and dim-witted recruit cruelly nicknamed Gomer Pyle (Vincent D\'Onofrio), until Pyle explodes into murderous revenge. In the second act, now set in Vietnam where Joker is doing a tour of duty as a military journalist, the protagonist and his fellow Marines find themselves on the front line during the Tet Offensive and Joker witnesses firsthand the savagery of war. Few films consist of such drastically opposed parts that differ in setting and tone and don’t have any overlapping characters besides the protagonist (and one minor character from the boot camp scenes). Full Metal Jacket has often disappointed viewers because the first half is so thrilling that it proves a hard act to follow. That\'s all down to R.\xa0Lee Ermey, who actually was a drill instructor during Vietnam and initially served only as a technical consultant before Kubrick decided to let him play the role and improvise. Ermey acts with a white-hot intensity, realism, and brilliantly worded insults and obscenities that no screenwriter could ever have come up with. As a young man, I too felt that the film was a letdown once it moved past the witty quips and goofy camaraderie of the boot camp scenes. With time, however, my appreciation for the film as a whole has only grown. The two-part structure now seems to be a strong yin-yang structure: the first act is a vision of order, while the second is all chaos. Furthermore, the second half is a moving statement of how war is often senseless. Joker and his squad, while on patrol for an enemy they cannot even identify and whose ideology or culture they know hardly anything of, begin to be targeted by a sniper. Several men perish before the sniper is found and neutralized, and all that death is pointless: it doesn\'t contribute in any way to victory for either side. The brutality of World War I trench warfare, where dozens of men could perish for merely a foot of conquered ground, is shown to have persisted through the American quagmire in Southeast Asia. That said, the film does have its flaws. One is the unrealistic depiction of the Vietnamese landscape. Kubrick had a great fear or dislike of foreign travel, and he insisted on shooting the whole film in East London. Having merely a few palm trees shipped in is a poor replacement for a real Southeast Asian shooting location with its humidity and insects, and in the scene that is meant to show a lively Vietnamese town square Kubrick obviously had the same few cars driving around in circles. It\'s strange how a director who was generally so perfectionist, could be so careless about locales (this only got worse with his next and last film, Eyes Wide Shut, with its inauthentic stage set New York City). There are also some anachronisms that this director and his technical advisors should have noticed.

This is the journey undertaken by Private ""Joker"" J.T. Davis, from brutal training camp to Vietnam itself. As most people know by now, Full Metal Jacket is divided very much into two different halves, halves that to me show the best and worst of the talented director, Stanley Kubrick. For the first part we are subjected to the training regime inflicted on wet behind the ears boys, boys soon to become Marines out in the harshness of the Vietnam War. This is real dehumanising stuff, frighteningly essayed by the brilliance of drill instructor R Lee Ermey\'s performance. We know, see and feel that the boys are primed to be killing machines, unemotional killing machines at that, with Kubrick astutely weaving the brutality of camp into the moral quandary that was the war itself. One particular recruit, Private Gomer (a heartfelt and unnervingly great Vincent D\'Onofrio) is the film, and Gustav Hasford\'s (writer of the novel and co screenwriter here) point of reference in this incredible first half. It\'s with this strand that ""Jacket"" burns itself into the soul of the viewer, to hopefully set us up for what will be Private ""Joker\'s"" (Matthew Modine) preparation for the Vietnam conflict. Then it\'s that second half... Where do we go from here? We already know that ""Joker"" and his mentally brutalised colleagues have been stripped of their basic humanity. Soldiers primed to kill, it\'s harsh, but true. But Kubrick has already chilled our blood and bludgeoned us repeatedly courtesy of the ""Boot Camp"" set up. Modine\'s (who isn\'t strong enough to carry the picture) ""Joker"" is now the film\'s axis, a clever, most definitely articulate character, who is thrust into the murky and muddled battle of the Tet Offensive, yeah and so? All it amounts to is a prolonged series of rationale and philosophical musings on the false war. Kubrick even shifting to safe mode with a clumsy narration segment spouted by ""Joker"". Full Metal Jacket is a truly fine film, but it\'s not the brilliant one it really should have been. If one can take the time to venture deeper with the second half, then it doesn\'t deliver on the already made point promise of the first part. Technically it\'s flawless, incredibly designed, with Douglas Milsome\'s cinematography stunningly effective.

A crucial disclaimer: you\'ll see countless reviews based on wholly different approaches. Some people will review it as a standalone, regular movie, while others will look at it as an extended/alternate cut of a film previously released. I\'m part of the latter group of reviewers. I find it a bit unfair to criticize pacing issues or an overlong runtime when the purpose of this cut is precisely to show everything Snyder had in his hand. Director/Extended/Ultimate Cut, call it what you feel it\'s appropriate, but it\'s a four-hour movie, so many scenes will inevitably drag or feel unnecessary and irrelevant. The narrative is fundamentally the same, which means the audience knows what\'s coming from a general perspective. Still, I\'m reviewing this version mostly on its own merits, but without forgetting that it\'s not a regular theatrical film and that it unquestionably builds upon what was already released. Without getting into spoilers, I do have to write this: the heavy marketing was incredibly misleading, and I don\'t doubt for a second that many fans will feel disappointed regarding certain story points and particular characters. The whole ""it\'s a totally distinct movie"" or ""Joss Whedon only used 10% of Snyder\'s footage"" were nothing more than false publicity for a cut that honestly didn\'t need it. Out of the 119 minutes of the 2017\'s version, probably around 80/90 minutes are also in the Snyder Cut, which will be surprising for people who expected something entirely unique. The base of the narrative is identical, most scenes are just extended versions of the original, but there are a couple of significant new changes that ultimately make Zack Snyder\'s Justice League better than its ""predecessor"". The most impactful modification that drastically changes the emotional core of the film is about Cyborg. Ray Fisher\'s character goes from barely having any remotely significant screentime in 2017 to being the heart and soul of the movie. From his backstory to the development across the runtime, Cyborg is undoubtedly the superhero that gains the most with this cut, leaving as a complete, compelling character who I genuinely cared for. On the other hand, Aquaman and The Flash receive similar introductory scenes with Batman, barely getting any sort of new individual growth besides more action sequences. However, once the League is assembled, the character interactions increase, improving their team spirit and deeply elevating the ""Us United"" storyline. The humor and tone remain lighter than in other Snyder films, clearly something that the filmmaker always had in mind for his version (Whedon only added a couple of more jokes since most of them are present in this cut). The intimidating runtime does negatively affect the overall pacing, but the longer build-ups and extensive dialogue scenes make the full movie much more cohesive and coherent. Compared to the original\'s abrupt, awful editing work, the Snyder Cut has a tremendously better flow, giving time for information to sink in and characters to get used to each other. I rather watch an overlong film with a well-built story than the complete contrary. Some color changes and tone adjustments also improve the movie\'s consistency. Story-wise, besides the fantastic arc given to Cyborg, there are a couple of changes that heavily affect either a particular character or a secondary storyline, but when it comes to the main narrative, it\'s more or less about the same. Every action sequence with pre-existent footage is visually improved and extended with scenes not seen before, but the new VFX are as hit-and-miss as Junkie XL\'s score. The latter mixes up so many different types of tracks and music that it genuinely becomes a tad confusing. While some scenes get an absolutely perfect, epic soundtrack, others receive weird, out-of-place music distracting the scene itself. There\'s only one change I definitely dislike: the R rating brings horribly artificial, forced blood splashes and out-of-nowhere cursing that simply don\'t belong in the film. I know Snyder loves his gritty, bloody, gory action - as do I - but either the whole movie is consistent with this type of action, or some scenes will feel like they come from a wholly separate film. A few bloody sequences work well enough, but most just feel notably forced, while the cursing feels ridiculously out-of-character at points. It\'s by far the most incompatible aspect of the cut, but admittedly, one that doesn\'t heavily impact my opinion. A common issue I have with extended cuts is that these mostly add and rarely remove. Snyder Cut partially breaks that rule, removing some scenes from the 2017\'s version, supposedly only Whedon\'s footage (which some people wrongly believe to be almost the entire movie). While most of the decisions regarding this process are efficient, there\'s a couple of them that not only don\'t improve the respective storylines but actually make them less powerful than the theatrical film. For example, in Snyder Cut, the ""bringing Superman back"" arc lacks an important character\'s take on the situation, having in mind that character\'s past. It actually feels a bit out-of-character that the viewers don\'t get to see what that person thinks about a potentially devastating action. Regarding Steppenwolf, his design looks better than the terrible original, and his motivations are clearer, but unfortunately, he remains a generic CGI punching bag for our superheroes. His dynamic armor is packed with spikes, but it\'s really one of those designs with visual impact only since it has no effect whatsoever in battle. I can\'t get into spoilers about Darkseid or DeSaad, but I can safely write that these characters are nothing more than fan-service, just like Joker (Jared Leto). The ending is definitely the sequence that changes the most due to the addition of dozens of new/extended action scenes, and it does play out differently - though the conclusion is essentially the same - leaving the viewers with a menacing threat on the horizon. Zack Snyder\'s Justice League is arguably a more cohesive, consistent, and emotionally compelling movie than the 2017\'s version. As expected, its four-hour runtime causes pacing issues and possesses dozens of unnecessary, irrelevant scenes, but criticizing these aspects in an admittedly non-theatrical cut is unfairly defeating its purpose. Despite most of the original Justice League being present in the Snyder Cut - something that might surprise a few fans - the main narrative is built and developed through a structure that flows tremendously better than the previous edition. Cyborg becoming the emotional core of the story and the increased character interactions are some of the best changes Zack Snyder and Chris Terrio did. The extended action sequences are more riveting, and pre-existent footage is definitely improved, but the new VFX are as erratic as Junkie XL\'s all-over-the-place score. The R-rating is the only straight-up negative aspect that damages the film with highly forced, fake-looking blood and rare yet cringe-worthy cursing. Highly anticipated characters and/or storylines are better described as unimpactful fan-service, but overall, most of the decisions made vastly improve upon what was already built. In the end, I sincerely expect a significant majority of the fandom to get their expectations fulfilled, and I hope that the DCEU continues with Snyder involved - just as long as the studios leave filmmakers to do their job without nonsensical restrictions.

However, I’m fairly well versed in them and the Justice League is my favorite DC team. When it was announced that DC would come out with a Justice League movie after the Avengers, I had hope...that is until I learned that they’d be doing a team movie first and individual movies afterward. This is the exact opposite of what Marvel did. During the production of the first movie, Zack Snyder had the incredibly unfortunate disposition of learning that his daughter had committed suicide. Understandably, he took a break from the movie. Because Warner executives don’t understand anything, they went on with the production. Hiring Joss Whedon to finish the production, the final product was lackluster at best. In typical Zack Snyder style, it was more flash than substance. After it came out, Zack went public and said that the movie was nowhere near his final vision. Not long after this, the hashtag #releasethesnydercut was trending on Twitter. Four years later, the director’s cut was completed and we got a monstrosity of a movie. Now the true question is “Was this movie worth the hype?” Honestly...not really. Now I write this from the point of view of one who’s been a comic book fan for 32 years. Also realize that there are MANY stories that I haven’t read and equally as many storylines that I’m ignorant to. However, I understand the characters. I’m a firm believer that character develops story. George Lucas said: “A Special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.” This is a lesson that Zack Snyder has never learned. Now, Joss Whedon gave us an amazing movie with The Avengers - and that’s the only comparison that I’ll make - so it’s possible that WB wanted some of that lightning in a bottle for JL and that’s why they brought him on. When Ray Fisher went public and said that Joss created a hostile work environment (as well as one of the producers), the way it was presented was that he didn’t get things that he wanted, so he’d complain. I’m glad to admit that I was wrong in that assumption. Ray actually opened the floodgates against Joss and it turns out that he’s not a good person - he’s a great writer and filmmaker, but that doesn’t make up for his behavior. This is relevant (and the last time I’ll mention it) because a good portion of this movie has Cyborg in it. The majority of his scenes were heavily cut from the first movie. Like 90% majority. I appreciate Zack wanting his vision to get out - every director has the right to tell a story the way they want to - but I wish that he’d step away from the writing process. He’s a great filmmaker but not a great storyteller. He needs a writer that has synergy with him. That being said, the special effects are very well done, although I REALLY wish the comics would have been honored better. Simple things like the way the Boom Tubes were portrayed would have been great fan service. Also, the boxes are FATHER Boxes. A Mother Box is a little bit larger than a cellphone. Father Boxes are used for evil on Apokolips and the Mother Box is used for good on New Genesis. If a feministic agenda caused that change, then I disagree with the studio’s decision and a quick 15-second explanation (like what I just did) would have solved that problem and added more to the plot (all the while giving a nod to the New Gods). Yes, I’m critical but it’s important. My favorite of the cast is Gal Gadot. She captures the essence of Wonder Woman perfectly. I also like Ben Affleck as Batman - I’ve always supported him in the role and he does a really good job with it. In fact, he’s second only to MIchael Keaton.\nNow this is where I’m probably going to get a lot of hate, so if if happens...bring it on… EVERYONE else in the cast I hate. EVERYONE. Ezra Miller is easily the worst Barry Allen ever. He’s supposed to be Barry, but he acts like an immature Wally. Absolutely terrible. I HATE Henry Cavill as Superman. He’s bottom of the list for me. I think Man Of Steel sealed that opinion for me, but he’s just terrible. His suit in this was sharp, so I’ll give credit where it’s due. Ray Fisher actually didn’t do a terrible job as Cyborg, but I’d never put Cyborg in the Justice League. If they wanted a robot-type character, they could have easily used Red Tornado.\nJason Momoa is just awful. He’s not Aquaman. I don’t care that he doesn’t have blond hair. He doesn’t fit the role. It would have been much better if he was cast as Lobo. He’s a much better fit there. We also get a brief cameo by another Justice Leaguer that was a wasted opportunity but sets up a sequel that will probably never happen. I understand that Zack likes big spectacular shots in his movies. I understand that he wants these heroes to be larger than life. However, his style is very arthouse - there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. There’s quite a few superheroes that would benefit from that style of filmmaking. These aren’t those superheroes. Zack needs to understand that many times less is more. Ultimately, this movie is an anomaly. It’s an improvement on the first movie, but it’s not better. It tried to do so much, but had the individual hero movies come out first, there would have been so much more to the story. Instead, everything is crammed into this four hour long beast that doesn’t accomplish as much as it wanted.

The original 2017Justice Leaguecut was unbearable to watch, each line of dialogue felt out of place and extremely corny. I was physically cringing at almost every scene. These problems are completely wiped away in the Snyder Cut allowing for a more character focused and emotional telling of the dawn of the Justice League. The entire film is completely different, with scenes completely cut and the order adjusted to have a more organic viewing experience. With a runtime of four hours, I was really nervous of feeling bored or the movie having a large amount of filler to pad the runtime, but that is not the case. Each scene is crafted perfectly to deliver important character depth, allowing the viewer to gain an emotional connection with each of our heroes. Cyborg, Flash, and Aquaman all have very fleshed out introductions, giving the audience a glimpse of their motivations and struggles living in a world with their powers. Cyborg has a tremendous arc with his struggling relationship with his father, which gets great pay off in the end of the film. The Flash feels grounded too with his motivation for fighting crime to help prove his father's innocence. With this new perspective and tone, his quips feel more like that of an immature kid (much like Spider-Man) rather than infused comedy that was forced by the corporate overlords. Batman and Wonder Woman are great in this film, with each giving arguably their best performance as their respective characters. Batman feels like a man who has truly learned from his past mistakes and wants to gather and lead his team rather than divide. Wonder Woman is a confident bad-ass Amazon who's heartfelt and understanding presence is the glue that holds the team together. Aquaman does not have all that much of an arc in this film but has a great lead into his solo movie which is noteworthy. Not only are the hero's more fleshed out but so are the villains. Steppenwolf has an actual motivation that the audience can sympathize with and understand. This leads him to feel more genuine in his conquest to take over the world. Steppenwolf plays really well with the backdrop of Darkseid who is looming in the background of every scene of our villain. It really creates a relationship akin to the Emperor and Darth Vader. The introduction of the life equation adds much more stakes and an emphasis on what the conquest is actually about. The action in this movie is great. The R rating added more room for the scenes to be more brutal and visceral with blood and gore, and even a beheading! While the majority of the film had pretty decent CGI, there were a few scenes that looked really out of place. Especially the ones with Darkseid and his lackies, which reminded me of a character straight out of a PS2 game. This largely had to do with the limited budget and time constraints the Synder Cut was given.\nThis film delivers on Zach Snyder's vision of Justice League, and I am so happy it exists. Although it also brings a sense of sadness as well, because the movie sets up for so much potential for the DCEU and now that future has all but vanished.

This is not a bad strategy. An hour at a time of this gargantuan abomination is more than any thinking person can bear. ZSJL reminds me of Ambrose Bierce's famous book review; “The covers of this book are too far apart.” It doesn't help either that half the movie seems to occur in slow motion. Superman's quote-unquote death has resulted in the reactivation of the “Mother Boxes” and the appearance of Darkseid's servant Steppenwolf on Earth. Steppenwolf hails from Apokolips, a planet that exists on a different plane of existence from the regular DC Universe, in spite of which he speaks perfect English, and his name is a German word for an animal presumably found only on Earth. Steppenwolf retrieves a Mother Box from Themyscira, following a battle of incredible proportions – not because it involves mythological beings and alien deities, but because the world of the Amazons is almost entirely computer generated, its scenery only slightly more sophisticated than an Age of Empires screenshot. How can this movie ask us to believe in a place like Themyscira, when the film itself doesn't seem to have much faith in its existence? This is symptomatic of ZSJL, much of which takes place in a setting completely divorced from the real world – and my complaint is not that it's unrealistic, because ZSJL is fantasy after all; my problem is that it's not real. I mean, it's just not there. Other than as childhood wish fulfillment, true-blue superheroes are very hard – sometimes even impossible, as with the immortal, omnipotent Superman – to identify with or care about; their physical and moral perfection renders them boring and predictable. ZSJL makes it even harder by placing them in front of green/blue screens most of the time, constantly surrounded by wall-to-wall CGI, and unconvincingly engaging enemies who are literally an afterthought – digitally added in post-production, and very poorly at that. And speaking of characters that are nothing short of caricatures, there’s Flash (Ezra Miller). Barry Allen is annoying, irritating, obnoxious, insufferable, grating. He's like a very fast Jar Jar Binks. He's like the bastard son of Andy Dick and French Stewart. If he's so quick, why does it take him so long to get off my screen? All things considered, there's nothing here we haven't seen in Avengers. Darkseid is Thanos, the Mother Boxes are the Infinity Stones, Batman is Ironman, etc., etc. The one difference is that Zack Snyder's Justice League is, though I would not have thought it possible, longer and more boring than any Marvel movie.

Well it made me smile anyway, as does quite a lot of this thought-provoking drama. It centres around this learned man who is to travel to Lund next day to receive a great honour for his services to the medical profession. In the middle of the night, he disturbs his no-nonsense housekeeper ""Agda"" (a charming effort from Julian Kindahl) announcing plans to drive from Stockholm rather than fly.

Initially, they just call him ""later"" as that\'s his most often used expression as he takes his leave, but gradually they take to this man who appears to have depths that bely his slightly friendly but diffident attitude.

Its plot combines three strands that lead inevitably to this doomsday. In the first, an Air Force base commander (Sterling Hayden) goes insane and launches the go-code for his B52s to drop the bomb on their targets in Russia, while a British captain on an officer exchange program (Peter Sellers) tries to reason with him. In the second strand, we see the crew of a B52 commanded by the cowboyish Major Kong (Slim Pickens) as they prepare to drop the bomb. Finally, there are the scenes from the Pentagon war room, where the American president (again Peter Sellers) harangues a general (George\xa0C. Scott) about how this could have happened, until the mysterious German scientist Dr.\xa0Strangelove (Peter Sellers yet again) offers a solution. Originally meant to be a straightforward adaptation of a political thriller novel, Dr.\xa0Strangelove became a madcap comedy. The characters' sexual quirks, anti-Communist hysteria and nonchalance about the coming apocalypse and are exaggerated to the point of farce. No other Peter Sellers film shows off his range of talents so well: he segues effortlessly between Captain Mandrake, a nervous fellow with a British accident already antiquated at the time the film was made, the staid American politician President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove, one of the Nazi scientists that the USA brought over after World War\xa0II. Filmgoers must have perceived this film somewhat differently, when the threat of nuclear annihilation felt very real. Contemporary audiences won't fully get how black this black comedy is.

This film is one of the best of director Stanley Kubrick's career, and is also one of the most iconic and acidic satire that cinema has ever seen. Inspired by a tense novel that was published in the same period, and by the political and military events that were taking place at the time, the film shoots in all directions to give us the most absurd and ridiculous image of the rivalry between the USA and the Soviet Union. Despite everything, and all the points in favor, I don't think this film is a true comedy. To me, honestly, it didn't make me laugh, although I absorb and understand the acidic irony that is here. The script begins with a very serious incident that could be true (and the US even reviewed its military strategies in order to prevent something similar from happening in real life): after inventing, in his troubled mind, a crazy conspiracy theory according to which the Soviets are poisoning American drinking water, a crazed general initiates a pre-orchestrated military protocol designed to retaliate against a Russian attack with the full force of their nuclear arsenal. But with one detail: there was no Russian attack, which would make the Americans the aggressor country, and responsible for a holocaust of biblical proportions. Informed of this, the president meets with his generals and, in direct articulation with the Kremlin, tries by all means to prevent the worst. What's extraordinary about this film is the way it ridicules the sexual arousal that several characters have around nuclear war. For these characters, the end of the world, total war, is an absolute fetish, portrayed in almost erotic detail. The most obvious cases are Generals Ripper and Turgidson: each, in his own way, vehemently expressing the mental connection they make between sex and war. Whether by the way they speak and express themselves, or more implicitly, by holding phallic elements that are increasingly evident, they are men who are horny in war. In the same line of thought, the commander of the American aircraft, who becomes a cowboy on horseback in the bomb, as if this were an extension of his male phallus. And what about the character of Strangelove? His name says it all! He is a Nazi scientist in the service of the Americans, and the way he tries to contain his excitement in anticipation of the end of the world is evident, for example, in the idea he suggests of a bunker where the survivors, handpicked (the Nazi idea of the eugenics is very present here), would spend their time having sex to save the human race. This is one of the great films in the career of Peter Sellers, a British actor who is famous for comedy. I've seen several of his films, and I already know his ability to play more than one character in the same film. Here, he gives life to three of the main characters, always with the same quality and professionalism. He is so good that it was really difficult to recognize the actor. George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden are also to be congratulated for the work they did in this film, which was certainly one of the ones that most immortalized them as actors. The best technical aspect of the film is the cinematography. Kubrick used various techniques to convey his erotic-military message, such as the opening credits, where an in-flight refueling becomes a symbolic copulation. The camera framing was also thought out in detail, with strategically placed close-up scenes, some characters very well highlighted and others reduced to the smallest expression of themselves (the American president, who is portrayed as incompetent, like his army is able to control). The film is a true lesson in black-and-white cinematography. The sets and costumes are also excellent, and the attack on the air base is one of the best and most realistic combat scenes I've seen in a modern war film. The soundtrack, finally, is one of the most ironic there is, and it perfectly matches the tone of the film. Highlight, of course, for the opening and ending themes."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'Just as ""Seven Days in May"" was hitting our screens, Stanley Kubrick used a superbly over-the-top effort from Sterling Hayden to depict a rogue general who has decided to use all the checks and balances in place to defend the United States to his own mischievous advantage and launch a pre-emptive bombing campaign on those pesky ""Ruskies"". It\'s only his perfectly moustachioed British executive officer ""Mandrake"" (Peter Sellers) who smells a rat, but he is on lockdown in their air force base that is, indeed, being besieged - but not by the ""Reds"".

With all this mistrust and mayhem abounding, is it going to be possible to avert the destruction of humanity? Sellers has multiple parts and carries them out effectively, but it\'s the support from Hayden, Scott and the gung-ho, yee-ha, merchant ""Maj. Kong"" (Slim Pickens) - in charge of the heavily laden bomber that is likely to stat the conflagration, that demonstrate really entertainingly not just the faults in the whole principle of a paranoia-driven command and control structure, but also of the flaws of human nature when it comes to increasing reliance on technology and automation.

For a film lover such as myself it feels redundant writing a review for Double Indemnity, because quite simply there's nothing to say that hasn't been said already. The esteem it is held in is justified, it's a razor sharp noir across the board and can be put up as one of the classic noir era pictures that got lovers of the form interested in the first place. Based around the infamous Snyder/Gray case of 1927, Wilder and Chandler fill the story with a sinister cynicism that is palpable in the extreme. With a script positively pumped with hard boiled dialogue, a simple case of murder becomes so much more, a labyrinth of devious cunning and foolishness, with a trio of top performances crowning this topper. Technically via aural and visual work the story gains extra spice. Rosza provides a score that frays the nerves, imbuing the sense of doom and edginess required for plotting. Seitz excels, the photography a trademark for noir, heavy shadows, abrupt camera angles and menacing shards of light come to the fore.

I\'ve previously had the opportunity to mention that I really like noir films, and this is another one that I had the pleasure of seeing and will save for occasional rewatches. Based on a good detective novel, the film is extremely intelligent, dark and well articulated. Made in 1944, still during the Second World War, it was nominated the following year for seven Oscars (Best Film, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Screenplay, Best Sound, Best Black-and-White Cinematography and Best Original Soundtrack for Comedy or Drama). I naturally wasn\'t alive at the time, but I imagine it was one of the favorite films at that year\'s awards gala. Interestingly, and not without injustice, it lost them all. Directed in a very intelligent and effective way by Billy Wilder (who was one of the great directors of Hollywood\'s golden era), the film has excellent cinematography, with magnificent clarity and play of light that takes advantage of the sun, shutters and other forms of soften the brightness when necessary. The soundtrack, by Miklós Rózsa, is very well-used and atmospheric. The script is excellent and was based on a very good dramatic story: an insurance agent is seduced by a woman and then tricked into helping her kill her husband and receive the money from a huge accident insurance policy. It turns out that insurance companies can be more meticulous than the police and, while the authorities are satisfied with an “accident”, some elements of the company are not uninterested in the matter. Could it have been better? Perhaps if the man\'s death was more nebulous and the perpetrator was not evident. Fred MacMurray had, in this film, the opportunity to give the greatest performance of his entire film career. Despite being a good actor and having participated in more projects, it was this film that immortalized him and meant that his name did not disappear completely. It\'s not a perfect performance, the actor is a little too theatrical at times, but it worked great. The role of the femme fatale was masterfully played by Barbara Stanwick, another great actress who deserves applause for the work developed here. In addition to being very beautiful, she gave the character an aura of perfidy and callousness, and had an exceptional rapport with MacMurray, full of tension and restrained desire.

This is an impeccably detailed, beautifully acted, refined drama with a strong feminist angle that’s as stirring as it is thought-provoking. Marianne (Noémie Merlant) is commissioned to paint the wedding portrait of Héloïse (Adèle Haenel), a young woman who has just left the convent. Because Héloïse is a very reluctant bride-to-be, Marianne arrives under the guise of companionship, observing the smallest of details about the woman by day and secretly painting her by firelight at night. As the two women spend their days with one another, intimacy and attraction grow, and the portrait becomes a symbol of the intensity of their love. The lead performances are mannered and structured in the most effective way. The strong desire between the two women is manifested in a gaze or careful examination of a wisp of hair or the way Héloïse crosses her hands. There’s a quiet intensity to the emotional and physical intimacy between these two women, making this love story’s end feel all the more heartbreaking. This is mostly an all-female film, and the men briefly seen on screen play little importance. Rounding out the characters are Héloïse’s mother (Valeria Golino) and housekeeper Sophie (Luàna Bajrami), who both fill critical roles in the story as the film explores issues affecting women at the time, including arranged marriages, career expectations, and health concerns. The film itself is absolutely stunning, with gorgeously romantic and lush cinematography by Claire Mathon setting a sensual tone that complements the story.

Some offered me a blast of pure entertainment, others left me crying like a baby, and dozens made me laugh uncontrollably. Nevertheless, the most memorable movies are the ones that profoundly impact me emotionally either by remembering me of a past phase of my life or by possessing main characters who I can strongly relate to. What might be ""just another film"" for most viewers can ultimately become a personal journey for other people in the audience, which is how I partially experienced The Father. I didn\'t have massive expectations for the movie itself, but I was curious to know how great Anthony Hopkins would be. While the legendary actor is undoubtedly a notable standout, Florian Zeller\'s creative, unconventional storytelling left me completely floored. By the end of the film, I felt emotionally drained of all my feelings and thoughts due to the increasingly heavier, devastating narrative co-written by Zeller and Christopher Hampton, adapted from the former\'s award-winning play, Le Père. This could have been yet another generic story about dementia, but Zeller\'s brilliant storytelling places the viewer in the protagonist\'s skin, offering a terrifying viewpoint of the disease. From the very first minute until the end, the spectators accompany Anthony, an old man starting to lose track of reality, through his own perspective. I genuinely don\'t know if this sort of point of view has been depicted before, particularly in the case of dementia, but either way, it\'s a harrowing experience that will surely leave a vast majority of its viewers extremely captivated throughout the entire runtime. Watching Anthony go through scenes that he wholly believes are indeed happening as he sees them is as attention-grabbing as it is frustrating and sad once the audience gets to see how the same scenes really played out. In fact, if one starts watching the movie without even knowing the synopsis, the first act will almost seem like a mystery-thriller due to so many twists and turns regarding previous conversations that Anthony and the viewers believe are 100% real. Zeller and Hampton\'s script doesn\'t only approach Anthony\'s feelings but also the loved ones surrounding him, which I firmly believe was both necessary and honest. The Father doesn\'t shy away from showing the boiled-up frustration and even desperation that the family usually goes through when dealing with someone with this terrible health condition. I have no words to describe how thoughtful and impactful Zeller\'s storytelling method ends up being. I found myself remarkably surprised once I realized the film had reached the one-hour mark. The control of the movie\'s pacing and tone is absolutely seamless. Technically, Yorgos Lamprinos\' editing work is as impeccable as Ben Smithard\'s lingering cinematography. However, it\'s Ludovico Einaudi\'s outstanding score that steals the spotlight in the technical realm. From the atmospheric, grand opera music to the more subtle tracks, Einaudi makes sure to elevate the critical moments with a noticeable sound that helps the viewer understand the progressive shift in Anthony\'s perception of reality. Zeller demonstrates immense talent in his feature film directorial debut. Being an adaptation from his own play certainly aids him in bringing the story from stage-to-screen, but his filmmaking choices are worthy of recognition, such as the extensive use of long takes to let the actors shine in their layered roles. And since I mentioned the cast... Anthony Hopkins delivers an award-worthy performance that only finds in Chadwick Boseman (Ma Rainey\'s Black Bottom) a serious rival for this year\'s awards season. Hopkins holds countless astonishing displays throughout his career, but this one is definitely one of my favorites. I never anticipated I\'d shed so many tears by watching an old man cry or getting slapped in the face, though it\'s not even due to the acts themselves but to everything that builds up those moments. During most of the runtime, I don\'t really feel sadness or anger. Instead, I feel every character\'s pain because it\'s incredibly hard to watch how everyone deals with the situation. Hopkins and Olivia Colman are undoubtedly the most impactful, but Olivia Williams and Imogen Poots also add a lot to the sentimental component. I insinuate above that The Father impacted me at a personal level. A little bit about my life: my grandfather didn\'t have dementia, but his mind slowly deteriorated until it reached a point where he had to spend his last few months on this planet stuck in a bed without really talking or moving. Still to this day, part of me regrets not spending that much time with him near the end, while the other part feels a bit relieved that my memory of him in his ""normal"" state remains intact. I always feared that if I visited him often in his last days of living, I\'d only remember his time at the nursing home instead of the years packed with tremendously essential lessons he taught me. This movie left me sleepless, spending the night thinking about that time of my life... The Father is an overwhelmingly devastating depiction of the painfully progressive disease that is dementia. Florian Zeller\'s extremely captivating storytelling places the viewers inside the protagonist\'s mind, making the audience witness and feel everything through his unclear perspective. Zeller and Christopher Hampton deliver a brilliantly unique screenplay packed with emotional punches that will leave no one indifferent. From the perfect editing to the persistent camera work, it\'s Ludovico Einaudi\'s gorgeous, impactful score that elevates the big moments. Zeller\'s use of long takes feels both necessary and important to attach the viewers\' attention to Anthony Hopkins, who delivers an award-worthy, powerfully compelling performance. One of my favorites of his entire career. Hopefully, this will be the closest I\'ll ever be to experience this mental condition.

Making his feature film directorial debut, Zeller gives the project a personal touch with much emotional gravity, as he’s so intimate with the source material. The film has the look and feel of a stage play, but it thrusts audiences into the main character’s head in a way that only the medium can achieve. Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) is growing increasingly confused in his day-to-day activities. At first he can’t remember where he left his watch, but later he doesn’t know if it’s morning or night. The man sometimes doesn’t recognize his daughter Anne (Olivia Colman), and he confuses his caregiver Laura (Imogen Poots) with others in his life with increasing frequency. As Anthony’s mind continues to decline at an alarming rate, he starts to have severe mood swings that are brought on from the frustration of his lifetime of memories slipping away. He refuses assistance from Anne, who is trying her best to help him cope. Change is never easy, but Anthony’s paranoia grows as the fabric of his reality unravels. The film features excellent turns from Hopkins and Coleman, two seasoned actors who carry the dialogue-heavy film. It’s fantastic work from both of them. Zeller puts viewers into Anthony’s shoes, adopting the old man’s mental state as he questions what’s real and what’s imagined. You’ll begin to wonder if his daughter and nurse are playing cruel games on him, with a sense of doubt that’s contagious.

This is fortunate, because he encounters what the military calls 'friendly fire' resulting from a baffling decision by co-writer/director Florian Zeller, who has a couple of characters played each by two different sets of actors. Thus Anne, Hopkins’s character’s (also named Anthony) daughter is played by Olivia Williams and Olivia Colman (who at least share some physical resemblance), while Anne's (ex)husband Paul is played by Rufus Sewell and Mark Gattis (who are like day and night). No wonder Anthony is so confused – as are we. There are certainly precedents for this type of casting, the most famous of which is That Obscure Object of Desire, in which Luis Buñuel alternates the role of Conchita between Carole Bouquet and Ángela Molina – but then Buñuel was a prankster, whereas The Father's theme of senile dementia is very serious and deserves to be treated accordingly. Now, I’m aware that it’s only natural for Anthony to think that his nurse is also his daughter, but the source of his confusion should be that the person he believes to be his daughter behaves like a nurse, and not the other way around. It would make more sense, comparatively, for Colman to play Anne and the nurse, and for Williams to only play the nurse, but not Anne. On the other hand, it doesn't make sense that the first time Anthony fails to recognize Anne we can't recognize her either, because then we think there’s something fishy going on. It would be far more dramatically effective if the actress Anthony doesn't recognize as his daughter is the one and only whom we identify as Anne. The protagonists turmoil is internal, and it’s Hopkins's duty to externalize it – of which the actor does a flawless job. The film's mise-en-scène works better to convey Anthony's cognitive impairment but, again, it is the character's mental feng shui, or lack thereof, that interests us, and which Hopkins expresses unequivocally through a masterful combination of oral and body language. It’s not that he's the best part of the movie; he is the movie. Hopkins puts on the proverbial clinic; his is a heartbreakingly beautiful performance, a veritable emotional roller coaster with sudden highs and unexpected lows. The Briton’s acting is all the more impressive because he makes it look easy – I mean, like Brando easy. And yet, it's as if Zeller doesn't quite trust Hopkins to make his vision a reality, hence all the visual gimmickry that hurts more than it helps (to paraphrase Jorge Luis Borges, saying something too much is as bad as not saying it).

I love pretty much everything that Pixar puts out, and at the start of 2020, I noticed that the studio was releasing not one but two original animated movies, something quite uncommon in their history (only happened in 2015 and 2017). Onward was yet another success, but everyone knew Soul was the studio\'s big gun. December release date means better chances to win an Oscar, and the highly anticipated return of Pete Docter (Monsters Inc., Up, Inside Out) to the director and writer\'s chairs also elevates the film\'s expectations. I\'m no different. My expectations were high as the sky, but the main question in my mind wasn\'t really if Soul was going to be a great movie, but if it would be so good I\'d love it more than Wolfwalkers, my favorite animated flick of the year so far? Well, let me write that it\'s a wonderful, beautiful, heartwarming tie. I love them both very much, and I wouldn\'t be surprised if I saw them in my Top10. However, this is Soul\'s spotlight, so let me get to it, and spit out the only minor issue I have with the film. During the first act, I couldn\'t feel a connection to the story nor the characters. It took me a while to really get fully invested in the narrative, and even technical aspects such as the animation style and the score (Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross) felt weirdly out-of-place and surprisingly not that enthralling. Nevertheless, this slow, unconvincing beginning doesn\'t negatively impact the movie overall, as most of these apparently awkward components improve as time goes by. From the moment it clicked with me, I went on that emotional rollercoaster I always expect to ride in a Pixar feature. The studio is known for its extremely heartfelt, shocking, tear-inducing third acts, and even though Soul isn\'t an exception to that rule, it\'s far from being one of those mind-blowing, jaw-dropping, devastating final minutes. Its third act is astonishingly emotional, and it sends a lovely message to the audience, one that made me reflect on the entire year and a specific moment in my life. Pete Docter, Mike Jones, and Kemp Powers explore the taboo subject of life\'s meaning in a predictable yet profound and entertaining manner. The approach on philosophical questions like ""what\'s my purpose?"", ""what\'s my spark?"", or ""what does it mean to have a soul?"" is cleverly developed and very well-written. There\'s a sequence with the protagonist near the end that will make tons of viewers experience it simultaneously. I found myself rewatching this scene in particular to help me remember a certain period in my life where I realized that what I thought was my destiny was, in fact, just one of those life passions that leave us with unforgettable memories. I was able to deal with that moment pretty well, but many people lose themselves once they figure out that what they thought they were meant to do/be isn\'t really what the future holds for them. They become lost souls, and only a spark of life can revitalize them. Soul explores this matter in such an authentic, genuine, creative way that I couldn\'t help but cry as I do in every Pixar film. Watching Soul will make you appreciate life a lot more, especially those tiny, little moments that we forget to remember. Living, with all its horrible phases, is the best life experience anyone can have. After a year of isolation and separation from the people we love, this movie arrives at the perfect time. Technically, the animation style and score didn\'t convince me in the first few minutes, but by the end, they\'re part of the key aspects that made me cry like a baby. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are starting to become two of my favorite composers (The Social Network, Gone Girl, Mank). Pete Docter proves that his undeniable talent behind the screen remains intact, and this time, he introduces Hollywood to the debutants Kemp Powers and Mike Jones. Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey (22) deliver some terrific voice work, so expect them to receive dozens of nominations. Finally, congratulations to every single artist that worked on this film\'s animation. These gifted people are the real stars of Pixar. All in all, Soul is everything I expected it to be. A classic Pixar feature, with the trademark emotionally powerful third act; a heartwarming, sweet, tear-inducing score; and a relatable, profound, well-explored story about our own soul and the meaning of life. Pete Docter delivers another award-worthy flick with the help of Kemp Powers and Mike Jones, and with the outstanding voices of Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey. It may start slow and follow a predictable path, but it\'s only a matter of time until every viewer connects with the main characters. Soul surpasses the barriers of cinema, becoming a healing media from which people can take away so, so much. It works seamlessly as a reflection on life, and as a motivation to truly live every single moment of it. It\'s the ideal movie to watch on the morning of Christmas Day with the entire family cozy and warm in the living room. I promise you: it will make you enjoy this festive season a lot more.

The film tells the story of a man who accidentally falls into a ditch and ""dies"". However, he does not accept his death and begins a journey into his own afterlife until he is able to reunite with his body, in a coma on earth. For a children\'s film, Soul is surprisingly deep, perhaps even too deep, especially for a child. The film touches on various existential themes, from purpose to the meaning of life, and will make us lose ourselves in thoughts about our own life. The characters are a marvel, especially the protagonists, because they are complete with complex layers that give us all kinds of feelings. The voices that bring them to life do an excellent job in making all the emotions that pass through them appear. When it comes to animation, once again Pixar exceeds itself and brings us a film that is a living work of art, each frame a beautiful picture of colours and movement that extends for two hours. It\'s really magical to see life on the small screen, the realism in some of the scenes will leave the audience really amazed. The smaller ones, however, may not understand the complexity of the film, and I don\'t feel that this is exactly the most entertaining film that will make them pay attention in 100% of the scenes, much due to the fact that it is not necessarily as energetic as many of the most watched animated films in recent years. It is, however, a valuable lesson that is present in the film, and letting children try to understand it will be the right choice to make when viewing Soul.

Whether it be a story of the survival of the fittest; the cleverest; the most devious; most beautiful - or a hybrid of some/all - it reflects poignantly how humanity always seeks to exist within a hierarchical structure (merited or otherwise, but perfectly epitomised here by the matriarchal, deific robot), but how much more effectively mankind can succeed if it accepts and values everyone and works together. It also clearly identifies the perennial problem of those with the brain always ending up far more successful, comfortable - and powerful than those who do the labour. Hence, this wonderful tale from Fritz Lang takes us to ""Metropolis"" - a totalitarian - though not necessarily intentionally malevolent - society, in which everyone has their place and role.

Boyd', 'Charmin Lee']","[{'writer': 'Manuel São Bento', 'score': '80%', 'review': 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com Streaming services have been growing exponentially, and with the current global pandemic deeply affecting the film industry, studios all around the world started to accept their movies’ fate. Controversy became a banal word in this debate, especially regarding the decision of exclusively distributing blockbusters and highly-anticipated films through Netflix, HBO, Disney+, Apple TV+, and more. Concerning this matter, I will always defend the theater experience as something unique and incomparable with home viewing, at least in a general way. Nevertheless, I think the most comprehensible path to accommodate everyone is to give the viewer both choices, and I firmly believe that would be the new norm, sooner or later. Why this apparently unrelated prologue? Well, Palmer is exclusively premiering on Apple TV+, which is probably the most underrated streaming service out there. Both their original movies (Wolfwalkers, On the Rocks) and TV shows (Servant) have become more and more successful, and their production quality unquestionably makes dozens of studios jealous. With that in mind, I believe an indie flick with a narrative like Palmer’s would always suffer at the box-office in a standard theatrical distribution, so I’m genuinely glad Apple caught it because I wouldn’t be surprised if it ends up as one of my favorite films of the year. I’ve seen Fisher Stevens before, but never in the director’s chair. I’m surprised at how much this movie positively impacted me. Cheryl Guerriero’s screenplay might not be groundbreaking or incredibly innovative, but it follows an extremely efficient formula that, when written and directed in the right manner, hits most viewers’ hearts. Boasting well-written, captivating dialogues that feel real, Palmer tells a cliche yet fascinating story featuring two exceptionally inspiring characters who can undoubtedly serve as a beautiful influence to many viewers going through similar life issues. Ryder Allen interprets Sam, a bullied kid with a remarkable amount of self-confidence and pride, even though he lives in a trailer with terrible parents and is made fun of by his school colleagues. He doesn’t let other people control his choices or what he likes, independently of what happens. His will and ultimate happiness in dressing up as a princess, having tea parties, or simply being “different” from everyone else (as described in the film) can have an extraordinary result in the audience, mainly kids. Regarding Ryder’s performance, I have no doubt he will be a heavy contender in categories concerning young actors since he delivers a heartfelt display that made me tear up by the end of the movie. When it comes to his adult counterpart, Justin Timberlake portrays Eddie Palmer, an ex-convict trying to get back on track after losing over a decade of his life due to an admittedly grave crime. However, as the character is presented and developed throughout the runtime, it becomes relatively easy to emotionally connect with Palmer. Even though his imprisonment was more than fair, Palmer demonstrates to be an altruistic, loving person who truly wants to redeem himself while admitting that he’s far from being considered “normal”, consequently creating an unbreakable bond with Sam. Timberlake genuinely surprised me with a grounded, experienced performance. In the end, it’s the astonishingly honest connection between Palmer and Sam that elevate the screenplay into such an inspirational narrative. There are other impactful and interesting relationships, namely between Palmer and Maggie Hayes (Alisha Wainwright), as well as between Palmer and his grandmother, Vivian (June Squibb). These characters significantly impact Palmer’s life, and the actresses were up to the task. However, Shelly (Juno Temple) is a terrible parent who I couldn’t feel sorry for, not even after certain acts of compassion that are meant for the viewers to forgive the character. Technically, just a quick praise to Tamar-kali’s subtle score that hit me in the right moments. I sincerely hope that this Fisher Stevens’ indie flick finds its audience at home because it’s a heartwarming, enlightening, emotionally compelling story of redemption and self-acceptance. Palmer might follow a generic formula that any viewer has seen at least a few dozen times, but Cheryl Guerriero’s well-written, efficient screenplay is brought to life in an incredibly authentic, genuine manner. The wonderful bond between Justin Timberlake and Ryder Allen’s characters is the film’s heart and soul. Both actors deliver outstanding performances, as well as the rest of the cast, but it’s the cliche yet heartfelt narrative packed with meaningful messages that ultimately brings up tears to the eyes. Despite the failed attempt to make the viewer feel compassion for Juno Temple’s character, Apple TV+ offers another highly commendable movie to watch with your family.

This redemption story about an ex-con who bonds with a misfit kid follows a tried-and-true blueprint that’s predictable and saccharine sweet, but the film has an honorable message of understanding and acceptance that celebrates unity — even if it does so on the most basic level. Former high school football star Eddie Palmer (Justin Timberlake) had his whole life ahead of him until a violent mistake turned the All-American boy into a convicted felon. After spending 12 years in prison, Palmer returns home to Louisiana and moves in with his grandmother Vivian (June Squibb). Grandma has taken a liking to the unusual 7-year-old boy named Sam (Ryder Allen) who is living next door with his deadbeat druggie mother, Shelly (Juno Temple). When the boy’s mom runs off for a much longer time than usual, Sam temporarily moves in with his neighbors. Circumstances change for everyone in the weeks that follow, and Palmer begins to notice that he and the eccentric young boy have more in common than either of them first thought. These two outcasts form a strong bond, each of them making a fresh start with their lives. The idea of a child who doesn’t conform to gender norms isn’t exactly a challenging topic for most of us in 2021, but the film is so charming that it could break through to the very people who need to be given a gentle nudge and lesson in acceptance. In fact, at first I thought this was a faith-based movie (until the sex scenes and swearing started). Timberlake and Allen have a sweet chemistry that is essential for a buddy movie like this to work. There are a lot of emotional bits that border on corny, but the film still doesn’t seem too artificial. The narrative falls into place as expected, and the uplifting story about being yourself and doing the best you can to make a difference in a child’s life will tug on many heartstrings. “Palmer” is hokey, but heartfelt.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Comedy', 31), ('Drama', 31), ('Thriller', 30), ('Action', 27), ('Other', 123)]}]",100,Yes!

The businessman is rarely at home, nor is the journalist\'s wife - which leaves the other two at increasingly loose ends. It isn\'t long before a friendship develops - usually over some noodles - and though entirely platonic, their relationship becomes solid and trusting. Then, something entirely unexpected occurs that causes the two to refocus their relationship in the face of betrayal and disappointment - and well.... What helps this film stand out are the performances from both Tony Leung (""Chow Mo-wan"") and the gorgeous Maggie Cheung (""Mrs. Chan"") - it\'s a love story, and it burns intensely - but not physically - as their story subsumes both themselves and the audience.

The plot goes in autopilot, following a very familiar path – and, as they say, familiarity breeds contempt. For starters, we have all the usual suspects; Liu Kang (Jordan Rodrigues), Sonya Blade (Jennifer Carpenter), and Johnny Cage (Joel McHale). The latter is the designated comedic character, at which he fails miserably – though the only laugh to be had here does have a little to do with him (or, rather, with a poster for one of his fictional films). Once the inevitable Tournament begins, the movie gives up completely and becomes an animated remake of the 1995 Mortal Kombat – and, I guess, an animated prequel or something to the 2021 version. Scorpion's Revenge is without a doubt the best looking of the three films; it’s also the closest to the game, and while that’s good in terms of gore, it’s not so good in terms of storyline. It’s just one fight after another, with little to distinguish each from the one before or the one after, and the characters are just as one-dimensional as their video game counterparts: Sonya is constantly trying to prove herself as good or better than the men, Cage is a buffoon who persists beyond the limits of reason in believing that the MK Tournament is his latest movie, and Liu Kang's dialogue consists almost entirely of Buddhist pseudo-koans.

The material was nothing new even when the film was released, but director Denis Villeneuve (pre-Dune) and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski work a few unexpected twists and turns into their maze to keep us on our toes. The key element, however, is Hugh Jackman’s career-best performance as Keller Dover, a father whose patience for police work quickly runs thin when Detective Loki (the always effective Jake Gyllenhaal) fails to find Dover’s kidnapped little daughter. It will surprise no one that Dover decides to take the law into his own hands, recruiting Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard), his best friend whose daughter has also gone missing, to kidnap the only suspect – whom the police has ruled out for the moment –, take him to an abandoned house, and beat a confession out of him. This is par for the course in the movies, but is it realistic? Can a father, however desperate he may be, really go from zero to psycho in no time flat? The film makes this transition 50% more believable by making the character a committed survivalist, meaning that he was halfway there all along. And even if we still found it hard to believe, Jackman would just browbeat us into believing it with a sadistic, ballistic, animalistic skin-shedding, raw nerve-baring performance wherein he doesn't just go berserk; he goes full on Beserker. In some twisted way, all this makes sense; the antagonist or antagonists are just as crazy as Dover, if not more: making children disappear is their way of “making war with God”. With that in mind, who better than a monster to find a monster? Dover may not in fact be too far off either, or is he? In one of those twists I mentioned, the movie toys with the Law of Economy of Characters by casting Paul Dano as the mentally challenged man on whom Dover’s suspicions (and fists, among other objects) fall. Gyllenhaal’s work is as strong Jackman’s, but more subtle and nuanced; he gives his Loki an eye tic which lets us know that, although he has solved all his cases, and belying his usual calm and collected demeanor, he has not gotten to where he is without some traumas of his own."", 'most_watched_genres': []}, {'writer': 'kisaligol', 'score': '40%', 'review': 'Prisoners is a largely generic revenge / suspense / mystery ""they have my kid"" tale with a predictable plot that gives itself away too early.

There are films that are made for commercial audiences and others that are clearly made to please specialized critics and film theorists. Although this film was present on the commercial circuit, the truth is that Wim Wenders directed this film for critics and film festival audiences, and this explains why critics love it and why the general public hardly knows this work. . About me? To be quite honest, I didn't particularly like the film, and it's not the kind of film I like to watch or watch with pleasure. However, I am the first to recognize that it is a work full of artistic and technical qualities, and that it deserves a close look by any student and fan of the seventh art. The plot revolves around a man who spent four years wandering through desert areas of Texas due to a huge psychological shock. We don't know what he suffered, but it is obvious that he is not well when he is finally rescued by his brother, and he spends a long time without saying a word, just trying to resume his march to nowhere. As the plot develops, we understand the emotional void he feels and desperately seeks to fill. The reunion with his son, whom he hadn't seen for years, will mark the beginning of a journey of inner healing, of reuniting with himself and the hurts of his past. The idea of family, the crisis of moral and social values, the role of men and women in marriage and the absence of feelings are themes that the film, very discreetly, addresses throughout the story it tells us. Anyone who wants to see this film should prepare themselves for a long, very visual experience: the film is a grueling two and a half hours long and the action is quite slow. Wenders, who even thought about becoming a painter, likes to work very carefully on the visual and pictorial side of his films, and the slow action allows him, in this specific case, to explore to the maximum the visual beauty of desert scenes or urban landscapes. of Texas, where the action is concentrated. Do I need to say that the choice of sets and filming locations was one of the aspects that I liked most? Thanks to a good cinematography job, each one looks even more beautiful, wild and rude. Harmonizing perfectly with all this, the soundtrack, on guitar, plays a little with the Wild West and with the melodies that we usually associate with the Western style. In addition to a very well done and solid plot, and good visual and technical values, the film also features the extraordinary work of Harry Dean Stanton. The actor has never been one of those stars that draws crowds, but he has quality and gives us here, probably, the best work of his film career. He is solid and impactful enough to capture our full attention with a minimum of words and facial expressions, and he doesn't say a word or change his facial expression during the first half hour of the film. The film also has excellent contributions from Dean Stockwell and Nastassja Kinski, and even young Hunter Carson does a well-done job.

For many, this movie is simply one of the greatest comedies of all time. However, I have serious doubts about that. In my personal opinion, it's a good comedy, it entertains its audience very well, and there's no doubt about its status as a movie classic. Starting from this reasonable basis and placing the film at the heights as the best or one of the best already seems unreasonable and exaggerated. But that's just what I think. The script is set during the Prohibition, a time when speakeasies were one of the biggest sources of financial income for mobsters. The script starts from this context and creates an interesting and reasonably well-written story, where two jazz musicians end up becoming witnesses to a massacre, in which a group of mobsters kills a rival group in Chicago. This, of course, was inspired by a true, very famous incident, the Valentine's Day Massacre. Persecuted and in life danger, they decide to dress up as two women and hide, like members of a female jazz orchestra that takes a train to the coast, to perform in a hotel. Of course, then the funniest part of the movie begins, with the characters trying to keep the cover-up amid the romantic shenanigans that unfold. In addition to a good script and good dialogue, the film has very good performances by Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, the two great male protagonists. For me, this is one of the most interesting films of both their careers, and it's great to see the way they both played together. I also liked the works of George Raft and Joe E. Brown, which gives soul and grace to the end, very famous and funny. Pat O'Brien also does a good job, even if he doesn't follow his peers closely. But the film was probably better known to audiences thanks to the female star, Marilyn Monroe. But I don't like her work here. She was an extraordinary singer, and her best scenes are the ones where she sings... but I never thought of her as a good and talented actress (she couldn't even memorize what she had to say, and the director practically swore that would never work with her again): and, really, her performance in the film is irritating, turning the character into a sly young woman and something of an idiot. The film doesn't make a big bet on the technical aspects, but it offers us high quality sets and costumes, good effects and an effective soundtrack.

I've articulated myself awfully I'm positive, way too many paragraphs and all that but hey-ho.] I don't even know where to start with 'The Hunt', I'm finding it difficult to seperate my thoughts. On the one hand I dislike a lot about this, from the writing to the pacing to the supposed message of it and from the clearly phenomenal acting. I usually solely focus on my own opinions and type up my review before reading others', but every now and then a film comes along that I just don't get and when it's one with surprisingly (to me) high acclaim I have to read other reviews to see if I've just simply missed something glaringly obvious - which is, even now, entirely possible, don't get me wrong. However, the vibe of a handful of reviews on here I've seen is either hate the kid(s) or hate the people for believing the kid(s)... surely that's not the point of the film? I'm aware this is perhaps too UK-centric a reference, but if that is the case it is giving major Tory/Brexit/GB News vibes. As in, it's (hate this word, but...) some sorta 'wokery', we must get rid of cancel culture and all that stupid rhetoric. Pre-reading reviews, I just simply didn't understand what the film was trying to say... and even by stating whatever, why it went around the houses for nearly two hours and then proceded to not even wrap it up. I personally found it exhausting to watch, I admittedly don't tend to enjoy films that attempt these sorta 'smart' open-ended endings. If all the film is trying to say is that people can sometimes be falsely accused and have their lifes ruined by mob mentality, then fine... but I'm not sure using child abuse is quite the way to portray that idea. It's hardly a regular real life occurrence of children (very young children, at that) ruining grown mens lifes with sexual assault claims, is it? That's what I mean with what I said three paragraphs back, it's like you see on social media when a well known person is alleged to have done something serious and you get that section of people who immediately hate the likely victim for no reason. Now, perhaps I'm unsure about this 2012 release as I'm judging through my 2023 eyes, as in the aforementioned online rhetoric has murked the waters in terms of what the film is actually trying to say. Nowadays it's closely associated with those who use the terms 'woke', 'snowflake' etc. and that makes me feel uncomfortable, I can't lie. Now, even all that aside, solely as film I still didn't really enjoy it either. The way parts are written and characters act annoyed me, e.g. the shop scene. From them all willing to fight Lucas one second to the next when they're all scared because he head-butted someone; and how they didn't see that coming, or Lucas himself didn't see the initial punch coming. I acknowledge that's a random example, but it kinda typifies how odd the film felt to me at most moments. As I said, I do have one positive and that is the acting - which is truly top notch, frustratingly so if anything as it makes it difficult for me to rate the film. Mads Mikkelsen is truly outstanding, one of the best performances I've seen from him thus far. Thomas Bo Larsen is quality as well. No-one on the cast puts a foot wrong in truth, even youngster Annika Wedderkopp or the more experienced Anne Louise Hassing. I get severely awkward when I'm rating a film so much lower than the majority, which doesn't happen all that often at all but when it does it makes me cringe.

To add to the woes of the teacher, he is simultaneously trying to re-establish a relationship with his teenage son “Marcus” (Lasse Fogelstrøm) who is, himself, a friend of the accuser and her family.

The refusal to engage, the denial of facilities and services, the overwhelming pressures of being guilty - regardless of authoritative investigation or chance for explanation or vindication. How can he get back in? Mikkelsen delivers compellingly here and the story and the dialogue becomes more desperate, harrowing even, as the story builds to a tense and unpredictable conclusion.

After two years of living together, Introverted Joel Barrish ( Jim Carey ) and extrovert Clementine Kruczynski ( Kate Winslet ) undertake extreme procedures to erase any memory of each other. What director Michel Gondry and Writer Charlie Kaufman have created is a movie designed to slowly release forgotten incidents and emotions as the audience discover the film is running in reverse. Bearing witness to love’s decay the audience are thrown sidelines with the introduction of Patrick ( Elijah Wood ) and Stan ( Mark Ruffalo ). Both Patrick and Stan work for Lacuna a private medical company with some rather dodgy practices regarding memory erasure. Along with Patrick and Stan, Mary ( Kirsten Dunst ) Stan’s girlfriend is also a work colleague and joins the other two when they are tasked with erasing any memory of Clementine from Joel’s mind. Patrick however uses information provided to Lacuna by both Joel and Clementine to manipulate Clementine in an attempt to get her to fall in love with him. What ensues is a battle of the mind to try and save their relationship after discovering that all was not as bad as the couple believed. But with each recalled memory there is a doomed ending that ends up being erased. The only hope is to try and hide Clementine in an earlier non related memory in Joel’s mind as Lacuna remove all traces of each other. The climax of the film comes with a surprise that complicates any post mind erasing procedures. “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” evokes real devastation in lost love and tells a fantasy tale of how we all try to erase those hurtful memories.

Whilst he is going through her stuff he discovers a card that declares she’s had him wiped. Despondent, he goes to see the same doctor (Tom Wilkinson) and opts for the same procedure. He has to garner together all their memorabilia so they can map his brain then “Stan” (Mark Ruffalo) and his sidekick “Patrick” (Elijah Wood) can come in while he’s asleep and do some cerebral zapping.

It’s this cat and mouse process that makes both realise what life might be like without the other! There’s a twist, too, though.

Meantime, there is the doctor’s secretary “Mary” (Kirsten Dunst) whom we also realise has skin in this rather complex game of truth or dare (to tell the truth)… I was never really a fan of Carrey but he’s on good form here, gelling well with Winslet in this quirky story of loneliness and reticence that allows each of the characters to have their moment in the sun. This is a creatively constructed drama that mixes chronologies and timelines to keep us guessing as to what’s real, what’s imaginary and what’s just wishful thinking as we see their relationship play out through multiple, rapidly evaporating, scenarios.

In the late Edo era (some decades before its end in 1868) a community is plagued by two opposing gangs who have built up a criminal empire of prostitution and gambling. Even the local officials are on the take. Into this town steps a nameless samurai (Toshiro Mifune). Once they get a taste of his swordsmanship, both sides want to hire him, but he decides to play them off against each other and free the innocent citizens from this evil. In past films Kurosawa had taken advantage of Mifune's ability to produce exaggerated facial expressions of laughter and fear. Here, however, the nameless samurai is completely unflappable, while it is the criminal bosses and corrupt officials who play the clowns. Ikio Sawamura is a town constable constantly toadying to the gangsters, for example, while Isuzu Yamada gives a memorably sassy performance as the madame of a brothel. In what would become a convention of the Japanese period drama, the numerous henchmen in the gangs were apparently chosen from the most grotesque men that Kurosawa could find (each furthermore has distinctively ratty attire), and one thug is played by an actor suffering from gigantism. That darkly comedic drama between the characters coexists with brutal violence. Yet, while audiences may have been shocked in 1961 by the samurai dispatching his opponents with realistic slashing sound effects and a hacked off limb, there are only a handful of fights here, and they are all over in a flash. (Indeed, one of the most striking aspects of Mifune's acting is his speed in executing the sword moves.) While Kurosawa delights in gangsters getting their comeuppance, he doesn't revel in gore. Much has been said about how this Japanese film would inspire Westerns made in America and Europe (Sergio Leone's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS was a straight-up remake). However, the film is also interesting for how it draws so much on influences from the West. Kurosawa's inspiration was an American crime caper by Dashiell Hammett, the samurai’s walk down the main street is drawn from the Westerns of John Ford and others, the soundtrack mixes Japanese music with Western instruments such as harpsichord, and Tatsuya Nakadai's pretty-boy looks are clearly modeled on Hollywood. All in all, I was very impressed by this film. Everything here – from the script and aspect to little things like the wind and dust and the little decorations on the set – seems the result of great effort and talent, all coming together to impress the viewer. And like Kurosawa's RASHOMON, it stays fresh even as its elements have been repeatedly reused by other film and television productions for half a century now."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 78), ('Comedy', 27), ('Romance', 22), ('Documentary', 13), ('Other', 53)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'I was surprised when I saw this, how late it was set - 19th Century - as I\'d always imagined it to be of a more historical nature. That doesn\'t remotely detract from the story though - as again Kurosawa casts Yoshirô Mifune (""Sanjûrô"") in the leading role. Here he is a wandering samurai who arrives in a village torn by strife. His skills are sought by the two opposing headmen and he quite successfully manages to play them off against each other - and keep the peace - until one the their sons arrives, armed with a pistol, and completely alters the balance of power. Mifune is superb as the maverick, thoroughly honourable and at times quite amusing ronin - I was reminded a little of the characterisation by Clint Eastwood in the Sergio Leone films - with a ruthless, violent streak: but somehow only towards those meritorious of their fate. It takes it\'s time, this - there is a fair degree of character development and as such, I felt quite invested in both Mifune and in his friend the innkeeper (Eijirô Tôno) as their peril gradually increases. The remainder of the cast adds to the tension well as does the frequent use of the weather in helping create the gripping atmosphere making this a corker of a film, very much worth watching.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Comedy', 18), ('Other', 113)]}]",100,Yes!

Before this film was released, many foreign viewers knew only the well-dressed, white, reserved and educated France depicted in e.g. films of the 1960s New Wave. Even many French people were unaware of the darker undercurrents of their own society, as no film had dared to handle this subject matter before. La Haine was a bombshell. While shot in 1995, it remains entirely topical today, as riots have continued to make the news in recent years. La Haine follows one day in the lives of three young men of different ethnic backgrounds all born and raised in one particular housing project: the aggressive Jew Vinz (Vincent Cassell), the insecure, clownish Arab Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui) and the more level-headed, pensive sub-Saharan African Hubert (Hubert Koundé). The film opens on a spring morning, in the aftermath of a riot which has rocked these youths\' housing project. Some cars and buildings are destroyed, and the news reports that a police officer has lost his gun in the chaos of the night before. During the 24-hour period before the film\'s shocking ending, this trio tours the bittersweet environment of their housing project (violence and poverty on one hand, loving families on the other) and, in an effort to pick up money owed to them, they navigate the alien environment (rich, educated, white) of downtown Paris. This is not only a revelatory film in showing viewers a side of France they had never seen before, but it is also extremely entertaining. The performances by these relatively unexperienced actors are totally convincing, Vincent Cassell in particular. Kassowitz shuns his country\'s own film tradition and instead sculpts the action under inspiration from the USA. However, the ""urban"", ""hip-hop"" aesthetic he employs does not lower the film to the more vacuous Hollywood productions but instead is at the level of Spike Lee and Scorsese. The director\'s decision to print the film in black and white has imbued it with a gravitas that makes it timeless. That said, in spite of the fine acting and ethnographic detail, the plot itself is rather mundane, which holds me back from giving this too high a rating.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 78), ('Comedy', 27), ('Romance', 22), ('Documentary', 13), ('Other', 53)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'It\'s not so much the individual acting with this that stands out, it is the collective effort of all concerned to demonstrate to us just how perilous life can be on their Parisian suburban housing estate.

How might things pan out for her as she ages, though? As her outward beauty begins to fade? Will any of them (or anyone else) still want her? Will she want them? The characters are quite roundly developed as director Marcel Carné takes his time to illustrate not just the persona of the heroine, but also those of her suitors whilst offering us a critique of a society in general that in early 19th century France mixed opulence with poverty, violence with tenderness. By using the different genres of theatre performances, Carné creatively provides us with a more subtle conduit between her series of trials and tribulations that allows us to tap into themes of culture and religion as well as human nature in many of it\'s guises. Arletty is on great form, as is Brasseur and given it was made just as the Nazi occupation was coming to it\'s own denouement, is quite an astonishingly artistic achievement that shows a nation with a healthy and defiant confidence in it\'s own identity and credentials.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Comedy', 18), ('Other', 113)]}]",100,Yes!

There aren't many perfect movies: At least, I don't know many. However, this film is almost certainly one of them. The result of an ideal combination of factors, which harmoniously came together to make it a work of art, it is a timeless film that is as pleasantly watched today as it was fifty years ago. But when we talk about classic films, it's far from being one of the first to come to mind. What is the reason? It's hard to explain, but I feel like the film never really touched the hearts of the general public. The film deserves more attention these days and is worth seeing. I'm not one of those who measure the quality of a film by the awards it receives (although that is always an indicant to consider as to quality)... but the film is one of the most nominated for the Oscars, with fourteen nominations, something that has only rarely been equaled, and six statuettes won, including Best Picture. The film begins by showing us a ceremony in which an actress, Eve, receives an important award for her performance in the theater. Then, the action goes back a year to, in flashback, let us know everything that happened until that moment. And that's how we follow the rise of Eve, an aspiring actress from obscure origins who manages to arouse the pity and sympathy of Margo Channing, then the biggest star of the stages. The film explores the two characters well, and the way they relate to each other. Eve is quite ambiguous for part of the movie, and even after we see the darker side of the character. Margo seems like a very insufferable shrew, but the character has a good heart, hidden under tons of ego and big theater diva tics. Based on a short story and intelligently developed by Joseph Mankiewicz, the director who will ensure the script, the film has an excellent cast and memorable dialogues, full of quotable phrases that we've probably heard somewhere. The cast is powerfully led by Bette Davis, an extremely talented, charismatic and full of personality actress who gave her all in this film, managing to achieve here, in my perspective, her work of glory. The difference between Margo, the character, and Davis, the real person, is so thin that you can almost say that the actress has taken the character and brought it a little bit into her own life. It's a truly superb dramatic exercise, and the same applies to the one given to us by its co-star, Anne Baxter, who plays Eve. The way they both collaborate in their scenes is mesmerizing. I also really liked Celeste Holm, George Sanders and Hugh Marlowe, even though the men in this cast aren't as strong as their female counterparts. Being a black and white film, this might be a bit off-putting to current audiences, but it's not something I see as a problem. On the contrary, I really liked the cinematography and I think the film has a lot of elegance and visual beauty. There are some scenes and camera movements that I found strange, but I think some are really unusual in films from this era. As for the costumes, I really liked the way they fit the story, and some of the actresses' costumes and dresses are pieces worthy of haute couture. The film has some implicit humor, which can escape the most inattentive, like that piano piece that Davis, intoxicated, listens to several times, later calling it “cheap sentimentality”."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '80%', 'review': 'Celeste Holm (""Karen"") takes pity on stage-door groupie ""Eve"" (Ann Baxter) when, after the umpteenth time, she encounters her hanging around waiting for the departure of stage star ""Margo Channing"" (Bette Davis). She decides to take her in and introduce her to her feisty idol. ""Channing"" - despite the rather brusque protestations of her assistant ""Birdie"" (a lovely effort from Thelma Ritter) - and writer ""Richards"" (Hugh Marlowe) take a bit of a shine to this endearing young woman who proceeds to regale them with a rather sad story explaining her current predicament. Next thing we know, ""Eve"" has ingratiated herself into the home of her new - and increasingly frustrated - mentor, and - well is she quite what she seems? Davis is at the top of here game in this drama. Her characterisation of the ageing star is potent and poignant - especially when she hosts a welcome home party for her soon-to-be husband ""Simpson"" (Gary Merrill) and the ""fasten your seatbelts"" quote is unleashed to devastating cinematic effect. Holm is also really quite effective as the conduit between these two women, but it is really Baxter who steals the show. You just know she can\'t be as pure and innocent, as sweetness and light as she portrays. Luckily, we have the dastardly critic ""Addison DeWitt"" (possibly a career best supporting performance from George Sanders) on hand to help keep the audience ahead of the plotting and scheming and also to ensure a certain amount of divine retribution is doled out as required at the end. This is a cracking drama with six principal characters left to develop and evolve in front of us exposing all that is good and bad about human nature and nurture. Joseph L. Mankiewicz adapts and allows Mary Orr\'s pithy and sharp story to accumulate gently but powerfully and even though it starts as it finishes, robbing the denouement of a touch of jeopardy, it\'s still one hell of a star-studded ""bumpy\' ride.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Comedy', 18), ('Other', 113)]}]",100,Yes!

The men experience the challenging claustrophobic life of serving on a U-boat with its highs and lows. Who will make it back alive? “Das Boot” (1981) is a well done accounting of what it was like to live on a U-boat in WW2 – the claustrophobic living conditions, boredom, filth, sheer terror and… no women. One great scene is when the submarine surfaces after torpedoing a couple ships in a British convoy; it’s like hell came to Earth. The flick focuses on the Germans in the restricted spaces of the U-boat and it’s amazing that a compelling film can be made from that limited dramatic angle. While this is a war picture, it doesn’t glorify war. It’s “anti-war” simply by showing the way it was for sub-mariners.

The film\'s slow pacing allows for an immersive experience, making viewers feel a part of the crew\'s long, tense moments of silence followed by the chaos of battle. The technical details and the psychological depth explored in the characters break down the traditional barriers of war movies, showing the crew as skilled, complex individuals rather than one-dimensional soldiers.

An example of young, barely pubescent, men sent to a war that would test their mettle to the extreme as they lived each day, perilously, as it came. This time, these young men are encased in a few hundred tons of creaking metal submarine and are tasked with harrying the Allied convoys travelling to and from the UK as World War II continued. The crew are led by an unorthodox captain (Jürgen Prochnow) and with the combination of underwater claustrophobia and paranoia now coupled with far more effective protection tactics from their enemy, the atmosphere in their sweaty and sweating sardine tin grows more and more tense. The film depicts with effective plausibility the lives of these submariners who have their successes, but as they gradually realise the war isn\'t quite going their way, they also face dangers on an increasing basis. The photography is expertly delivered using the natural dinginess of the boat\'s interior, the frequent hostility of the ocean and the failing mechanics of their home to present us with something that really does make for uncomfortable viewing - even if we ought not to have been ""on their side"" for a moment. Prochnow works well as the commander with a purpose, but also with a compassion for his struggling crew and a sense of decency that provides him with what might be a little too delicate a respect for his ""fat slob"" bosses in Berlin. The dialogue and it\'s cast-wide delivery also manages to create a real feeling of life-and-death scenarios as these men lurch from manmade risk to equally treacherous natural ones. Erwin Leder probably stands out more from the supporting cast as his ""Johann"" character epitomises most potently the strains under which these youngsters must prevail, but there are generally strong performances all around from an ensemble that illustrates powerfully the camaraderie and inter-dependence of a crew constantly living on the edge of it\'s nerves. It\'s almost perfectly paced, with moments of high drama and moments of quiet reflection which Wolfgang Petersen has crafted into an enthralling story of human endurance, temperament and determination. Big screen if you can, it does much more justice to the whole aesthetic of this drama, but even on the television it\'s an honest and compelling look at war.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Comedy', 18), ('Other', 113)]}]",100,Yes!

Two decades later, the team returned with Samsara, a sequel that wasn't really necessary. One reason that Samsara is not very good is that it often seems a shot-for-shot repeat of Baraka. The filmmakers revisit many of the same locations (such as Thai prostitutes, a chicken-processing plant, home appliance factories, landfill gleaners). Again Buddhism, the Ka'aba and high church Christianity are depicted, but because the film does not go on to any other religions than what was on Baraka, these rituals feel this time like cheap exoticism instead of unquenchable anthropological curiosity. SAMSARA also lacks the dramatic arc of Baraka, coming across as a random succession of images instead of the journey from sacredness to horror and back that we found in its predecessor. That is not to say that Samsara is completely without interest. There is an astonishing clip of performance artist Olivier de\xa0Sagaza, and the freakish Dubai landscape is depicting in a detail that few (even those who have been there) have seen. Samsara is all in all a darker film, and while depictions of the wreckage of Katrina, a Wyoming family that are proud to own an arsenal of guns, and a wounded veteran may fail to really shock viewers in the West who have already been exposed to such images for years, scenes of garish funerals in Nigeria and Indonesian men making the rounds in a sulphur mine (even though they know it is killing them) are stirring and memorable. Of course the visuals are rich, and in Bluray format on my HD projector the film is just as stunningly detailed as its predecessor. However, Samsara lacks enough new things to say, it surprisingly doesn't offer continual rewards on rewatching, and just by the fact that it exists out there it potentially dilutes the impact of Baraka, once a singular film. I was entertained enough to give this a 3-star rating, but I would still recommend Baraka, and even for those who have seen and loved Baraka, I would not recommend moving on to this film."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 78), ('Comedy', 27), ('Romance', 22), ('Documentary', 13), ('Other', 53)]}]",100,Yes!

Now, however, pending my watching the other version again, this might indeed be my new favorite. Not due to any major differences in acting ability or in the writing, but rather for the way it nails down the little things, the stuff I may not have noticed the first time or two I watched it. One simple example is of the portrayal of Mary, one of the servants in the Bennet household. She says hardly anything during the course of the movie, but a couple of times we follow her while she is singing as she works, and I found it utterly charming. And I think it illustrates, whether or not it was intended, that this is a pleasant house that servants did not dread to start their work days in. There is also at one of the balls a long scene of dancing that shows several of the characters who are involved in subplots going on, all within this continuous shot. It is clever, and on one website it is said the camera was left running by accident; a happy accident if you ask me. Also, a few of the scenic moments, such as one time when Elizabeth merely stares lost in thought in the middle of great beauty, are amiable natural breaks in the action. The acting is very good, of course, with this cast, but also their attitude is perfect. Brenda Blethyn excels in the thankless role of the silly mother, managing not to cross the line into looking outright ridiculous. Sutherland is — well, I will give any movie a try with him in it. Keira Knightly is, for me, astonishingly good. If you had described to me before I watched it the way, when she or her family is insulted, she looks jolted for a moment, but then with a short laugh or smile shakes it off, I would have said “Nope, that won’t work.” But it works. Her wit is sensational. I write fiction myself and always try to to feature witty female characters, and Elizabeth would fit right into my modern novels. Dame Penelope Wilton is excellent as always, and Claudia Blakey shone as Charlotte. If pressed to find at least one small fault, I could only say that I think the writers and director (and possibly Jane Austen herself) may have underestimated Mary Bennet as a character. I have always thought that more could be done with her, in every version.

I believe that “Pride and Prejudice” is one of the most transported English novels to film and television. I've seen more than one adaptation, and each one has its merits and problems (however, it's generally agreed that the 1995 miniseries is the most perfect and canonical). This film is not as good as I would like it to be, it has several problems, but it is quite acceptable and also has positive notes to retain. Here, the story we already know so well takes place in the final years of the 18th century. From what I saw, the director wanted to do this to avoid the fashion of the Regency period, which he doesn't like, and taking advantage of the fact that Austen wrote the early version of the book around this time. Well, I can say that I share the thoughts of the director, Joe Wright, when it comes to dresses from the Regency/First French Empire period. Aesthetically, they are much less interesting than the “bridal cakes” of the pre-French Revolution period, or the wide dresses that began to be worn in the Romantic period. The idea of these dresses, which greatly emphasize the woman's chest and then fall straight down like a nightgown, is in a way imitating what the Romans and Greeks were thought to wear. Even so, there are several errors in the way the characters were dressed, arranged, combed and characterized: basically, the director ignored everything that didn't suit him. That was a mistake. The film is reasonably short for the literary work it brings, but I think it couldn't be otherwise. For the rest, the narrative is decently done, and the adaptation made to the source material is quite conscientious and tries not to cut important things. What I didn't like was the way certain characters were developed: Elizabeth became a wild girl and much less contained than would be supposed in the novel, for example. The rest, however, is quite satisfactory. The film is full of great British actors: in addition to Keira Knightley, who manages well in the role of protagonist, we also have Rosamund Pike, Brenda Blethyn, Talulah Riley, Jena Malone and Judy Dench. Each did a fairly good job in the role assigned to them. We should also appreciate the work of Matthew MacFadyen, Donald Sutherland, Simon Woods and Tom Hollander.

The film oozes stately homes and fine costumes, the writing enlivens almost everyone - especially the on-form Blethyn whilst Dames Judi and Penelope (Wilton) bring some gravitas to offset the engaging effort from Knightley in a role the could almost have been written for her engaging performance here. The Darcy role is amiably enough played, but that role isn\'t really so important in substance - it\'s more about his dashing eye-candiness factor that is supposed to have the hearts a-fluttering.

Nolan’s three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and naïve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist’s life, chronicles his development of “the gadget” and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer’s odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture’s production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience.

He is the increasingly acclaimed, eponymous, physicist who is made aware by Admiral Lewis Strauss (another strong performance from Robert Downey Jr.) that it just possible that the Russians have the A-bomb. Now Oppenheimer already suspects that the Nazis are also well on their way to weaponising the atom - his earlier education and career had introduced him to some of the prominent minds in the UK and in Germany who were quite capable of taking the theory forward; so he begins to pressurise the American government to begin it\'s own programme - and the ""Manhattan Project"" is born. Motivated/goaded/galvanised by the ambitious ""Col. Groves"" (Matt Damon) he assembles a formidable collection of scientific minds at a purpose built, desert, location which he christens Los Alamos, and over the next three years - and with $2bn to spend - they work on the science whilst plutonium and uranium are being simultaneously processed at an irkingly glacial pace! Given that much of this is reasonably well documented history, the actual plot here has little by way of jeopardy. Instead, Christopher Nolan attempts via his writing and direction to put some meat on the bones of the characters here. It\'s clear that Oppenheimer is a bit of a Lothario, but it\'s also clear that he can engender the loyalty of a variety of people with diverging views - not just surrounding the science of their project, but around the morals and ethics of creating something that - well, you can\'t get the toothpaste back into the tube.

It also has quite a penetrating resonation about it - not just, specifically, about Oppeneheimer - but about all of those post-event ""enquiries"" that rarely deliver an honest appraisal of what was done in the name of expediency at the time, but ends up more of a character assassination exercise by those who didn\'t do anything against those who did and had to. Though at times the pace of this thing helps to keep it enthralling, it is too long - at times it really does plod along. Perhaps an other, objective, eye on the writing/direction may have tightened it up without having to sacrifice any of the potency of the story. Maybe someone needs to tell Mr. Nolan that a three hour film isn\'t always required! That said, it\'s a gorgeous film to look at. The aesthetics are first rate and the entire sentiment of the film reeks of authenticity. I do think this thrives better on a big screen so try to see it as it was intended.

Robert Oppenheimer. This profound epic clocks in at three hours yet never feels too long, even if it’s painfully clear that Nolan is indulging himself in a passion project. During World War II, Lt. General Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) appoints physicist Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Assembling a team of the brightest scientists the country has to offer, the experts spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. When their final product is used against Japan on July 16, 1945, the world witnesses its first nuclear explosion in an event that not only ends the war, but forever changes the course of history. There has been much hype about the fact that Nolan chose to film in IMAX, but the large format feels wasted here. The visuals are far from stunning, and the film is mostly a dramatic, dialogue-heavy history lesson that’s a far cry from what I’d call “entertaining.” It’s a great movie that’s engaging, sophisticated, and intelligent, but those expecting traditional thrills are going to be greatly disappointed. Save your money, because seeing this in IMAX isn’t really worth it. Nolan’s film is poignant in a way that’s chillingly relevant. His story not only explores one of the most important figures in U.S. history, but also makes you think about the current lack of empathy that’s plaguing society. There’s a very real moral question about humanity’s ability to make something that will help save the lives of many but also result in the death of innocents, and Nolan makes a strong political statement in a surprisingly restrained manner. His commentary on the far-reaching effects of such a powerful weapon born from the intersection of innovation, science, and government, while being an invention that has changed but also endangered the world, will give you chills. Nolan’s script is terrific, and is one of my favorite screenplays of the year. Nolan tells much more of the obscure back story of Oppenheimer’s professional and personal life that few know, and it makes for a lengthy (but interesting) narrative. The film includes his ties to the Communist Party, Hoover’s FBI investigation, his tangles with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), and an eventual closed-door hearing that was designed to strip him of his security clearance years after the war ended. “Oppenheimer” is a complex film that requires your full attention, with myriad characters and time jumps that will keep you on your toes. A basic knowledge of history is beneficial, but those who have only heard the name Robert Oppenheimer and are aware of the very basics (like the fact that he was involved in the creation of the atomic bomb) won’t be completely lost. In addition to complicated discussions of quantum physics, there are weighty themes about the dangers of government bureaucracy and the moral and ethical implications of creating a weapon of mass destruction. Nolan isn’t the type of storyteller who is keen on hand holding, and it’s refreshing to see a riveting movie that’s made for thinking audiences.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 31), ('Comedy', 31), ('Thriller', 30), ('Action', 27), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'Thulan Perera', 'score': '90%', 'review': ""The cinematic masterpiece that is Oppenheimer leaves an indelible impression on anyone who watches it.

Truman:[takes a handkerchief from his pocket and gives it to him] You think anyone in Hiroshima or Nagasaki gives a shit about who built the bomb? an incredibly well-written and extremely well-acted piece of dramatic cinema about the very eventful and complicated life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and it is beautiful. I'm actually surprised this is a huge summer blockbuster. anytime Christopher Nolan releases a film, it's obviously an event all around the world because he's made tons of great films and he's one of the very few film-makers working today who really cares about cinema and values that cinematic experience. he's also one of the very few people who's actually given a budget to support his love for cinema. he shoots on film, does everything practically, he wants as little CGI as possible and he has apparently claimed that there isn't a single CGI shot in this film. if that's actually the case, like if he hasn't even included cleanup shots in the film, then my spirit just left my body. it's astounding. went into this film with very limited knowledge about the life of Oppenheimer. like most people, I only knew him as The Father of the Atomic Bomb and the famous lines he quoted from the Bhagavad Gita which are Now I Am Become Death, The Destroyer of Worlds where he's talking about the atomic bomb realising the gravity of his creation and having to live with the sin of his achievement. I had no other knowledge about him as a person, his life outside of the invention, and the events that followed before or after it. so, if you're going into this film expecting an explosion porn, you're most likely to get disappointed having to sit through 3 hours' worth of heavy dramatic dialogue involving moments of genuinely terrifying character development. the film is about the person whose most pivotal moment in life was the success of The Manhattan Project. getting to experience being inside that person's mind as he's trying to visualize all these things combined with an incredible score by Ludwig Göransson and watching all of these rated-R, 3-hour, dialogue-heavy, beautifully shot on film by the master himself Hoyte van Hoytema with black and white sequences in a fucking theatre made me feel like I wasn't in 2023. the performances are excellent. there really is no other word for it. from the top all the way down to the bottom of the incredibly huge cast list, there isn't a single weak link. Robert Downey Jr. is simply terrific. I haven't seen him like this since Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which came all the way back in 2005. I love him as Iron Man but that's more about the character rather than him as an actor. I wouldn't be shocked if he's nominated for a best supporting actor performance. Emily Blunt is also just really really great. there is a sequence early on in the film where Oppenheimer is being questioned and she's just sitting back there in the scene, out of focus. we're not even shown a close-up of her during this entire sequence until it becomes relevant later on in the film and we go back to that sequence when we finally realise the significance of her being there. Nolan has done quite a lot of that in this film actually. major A-list actors are in the film for like 2 scenes and then they never appear again. that's not just a testament to the actors who'd give anything to be in a Nolan-directed film but a testament to Nolan himself, as a film-maker. if we go back to the same sequence I mentioned earlier with Blunt, that's not just anyone sitting there, it's Emily Blunt. a phenomenal actress. but that's what gives the film a sense of groundedness. that the people on-screen are actual people, they behave like people. and for a certain amount of time, allows those celebrities to feel like normal people. Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Jason Clarke, Dane DeHaan, I can go on and on but literally everyone is fucking phenomenal. the real star of the show though, is Cillian Murphy. in his first lead role for a Nolan film after having worked with him for almost 20 years, Murphy shines brighter than the atomic bomb itself and walks with suave leaving not just two, but a multitude of shockwaves. his work is beyond phenomenal here. he not only looks like Oppenheimer but every scene he's in, he's just instantly captivating. it's not just his incredible eyes (which go so deep that I just wanna sink myself in them) but, he's just always in character. never did I once see the guy from Red Eye or from Peaky Blinders. it was always Oppie. I'm actually putting this review as I listen to the absolutely bonkers score that has been provided for the film. Göransson's work is truly, awesome-tacularly, riveting. my heart was beating so fast in some sequences that have this heavy, beating sounds that I could almost have a seizure. the work here is truly remarkable. another aspect of this film that shines brighter than ever is its editing. this is a 3-hour film that feels like 2 and a half. a half-an-hour of time just evaporated for me. every scene ends perfectly. there is no room for baggage. several big moments of history fly away in an instant. this gives the film a really focused feel. it gives the audience a cue that this is not the story of the world but it is the story of Oppenheimer. Nolan really knows how to edit his films such that they have just the right runtime and I really appreciate when a film-maker does that. it very much also gives this film that documentary-esque aspect and gets you convinced that these events actually did happen and this is not just some made-up story about a man's life. this film is truly a marvelous achievement not just for Christopher Nolan himself as a filmmaker but for cinema as a whole. peak dramatic cinema. watch this on the biggest screen possible and the loudest speakers you can find."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 3), ('Action', 1), ('Comedy', 1), ('History', 1), ('Other', 2)]}, {'writer': 'aGoryLouie', 'score': 'N/A', 'review': 'excellent, a perfect example of true defined cinema\nAt a whopping three hours long it, very much like LOTR, feels considerably less.\nA must watch', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 33), ('Science Fiction', 30), ('Comedy', 26), ('Horror', 24), ('Other', 129)]}, {'writer': 'Peter McGinn', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'Well, with ten other reviews on this site, I am not going to give a blow-by-blow assessment of what I like or don’t like.

I surely recommend doing some research before and after watching the film to better understand it. I also recommend researching about the simple facts of the Manhattan Project, who the people involved in the Manhattan Project are, and who Oppenheimer is before and after watching the movie. WATCH IT ON THE BIGGEST IMAX SCREEN YOU CAN FIND, especially if you are interested in science, the true story of the Manhattan Project, and course, other Chris Nolan films. This movie was filmed specially for IMAX screening, Nolan and his crew used IMAX 70mm film and cameras, and they also invented the B&W 65mm film specially for this movie. I have watched every single Chris Nolan’s films ever since I was a kid. His movies have been a big part of my life and his movies are the things that helped me go through tough times and give me a new dream. Oppenheimer was just staggering. It was amazing, I do not have the words to describe my feelings watching that movie, especially seeing how much improvements Cillian, Nolan and other actors have gotten through over the years, and I was so glad that Cillian is finally getting the attention he deserves too. The cinematography, the storyline, the dialogues, the characters, the music, the camera angles, position, lighting, editing, the script, and everything else were just amazing. I have read every single line of the transcript and I have already rewatched the movie 5 times to better understand it. I also am reading the American Prometheus which is amazing. After my first time watching Oppenheimer, the thoughts and questions I had after watching it stayed with me for weeks, which led me to watch it again and again. I was amazed, it was breathtaking. The cinematography was beautiful and it couldn’t have been better. The fact that Nolan didn’t use CGI for the Trinity test scene and Oppenheimer's visions of the quantum world just made me more inspired. Five stars are not enough for this movie, neither are any stars and ratings in this world. This movie is out of this world and it is a masterpiece. The costumes in this movie were simply amazing. The costumes were very well designed, and the colours were also amazing. It also played a huge part in the movie and helped Nolan out a lot by just contributing to making his visuals and imagination come to life. The sound effect was unbelievable. The sound effects + Cinematography and Visual Effects made me feel like I was in the room with all the characters when all the events occurred. The Trinity test scene was also amazing, I loved how Nolan expressed the nervousness of the scientists before and after pressing the button. \nI also absolutely loved the soundtrack of this film. Ludwig Goransson used a variety of instruments and tempos to convey the mood of the scene and the emotions of a character. The soundtrack enhances the film scenes and makes the whole film much more interesting to watch. Nothing in this world, no headphones, earphones, and speakers can be used to replicate my feelings listening to these soundtracks in an IMAX theatre.\nThe casting was amazing too. The actors were excellent in portraying the difficult emotions of their characters. Cillian Murphy was amazing at representing the emotion Oppenheimer felt during his hardships over the years. The supporting actors and actresses were also amazing at playing the supporting parts in this movie and acting out how their characters had an impact on Oppenheimer's life. If you have already watched the film and found it very fun and interesting, and if you want to learn more about how the film was made, I highly recommend you watch videos online regarding Christopher Nolan's method of making this film. I also recommend you watch interviews and the bts of this film as you may learn more amazing things about the movie and Nolan's way of filmmaking. If you want to learn more about the Manhattan Project and especially Oppenheimer's life, I highly recommend you read The American Prometheus as it is the book that Chris Nolan took the inspiration and information for this film. Although it is quite long, it is worth it. I also recommend you read the transcript of this film if you have time, as you can understand the dialogues and words better and check the parts and details you may have missed in the movie. The script is written in first person POV: Oppenheimer's viewpoint, which makes it more interesting to read, and it makes you feel like you are in the same room as the characters, even without visual effects. I was amazed at the fact that Christopher Nolan did not use CGI for this movie. Almost everything was practical and CGI was only used to enhance the look. Nolan has already amazed the cinema society with his simply staggering practical effects that were huge and well-planned. Nolan used all sorts of creative ways to recreate the iconic Trinity Test scene and the unique visions of Oppenheimer. By watching the bts of Oppenheimer, you can see how determined Nolan is to bring a masterpiece to the table. Some people may find this movie boring. If you hate movies based on history, have zero interest in science, or hate movies that require a bit of thinking and researching before and after, then probably this movie may not be for you and you might find the movie extremelyboring.Of course, you should understand that everyone has different opinions and views about almost anything in this world so there is always a possibility that you may disagree with the things I have said here.Overall, this movie is a masterpiece. As a fan of Noaln's films and Cillian Murphy's acting ever since childhood, this film couldn't have been better. I definitely recommend you see this, as soon as possible, and on the biggest IMAX screen possible because it would be worth it. Of course, if you dislike the kinds of films I mentioned in the previous paragraphs, I don't recommend you see this film.

I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time (it helped that I wasn’t well-versed in the history of Robert Oppenheimer as a person, although I knew the gist of his story).   The non-linear plot format also helped to keep my attention as we see blips of Oppenheimer’s life as a student, working on the Manhattan Project, and the scrutiny he faced afterward.

Intentional or accidental, it’s within our ancestral blood. The unprejudiced can succumb to the immoral values of deceit, either through meticulous storytelling or scattershot deception. Even the truth can be distorted by one’s self-absorbed ego. The mutually contradictory stories of a bandit, Samurai and his wife, during a police questioning of an ambush, rape and murder, provides Kurosawa with the leverage to thematically explore the depths of human duplicity. A narrative conveyed through the perspective of four individuals, each telling a variation of the same event and asserting it as the truth. Yet who is moral? Who is verifiable? The answer lies within the embellishments of mankind. The egotistical residue enveloping the desires for personal gain. The bandit, openly admitting to the events in question, proud of his barbaric conquest. The wife, subjecting herself to sorrow and helplessness, innocently scarred from the visceral crime. The Samurai, communicating through a spiritual medium, self-gratifying his noble demise. And the distant woodcutter, examining the various preceding stories, acting as the fragile bystander solidifying his story as the whole truth. But when characters reside in a downbeat world where “you just can’t live unless you’re what you call selfish”, is anyone’s depiction correct? Is lying for personal gain and visibly stealing an abandoned baby’s clothing the same selfish endeavour? Variational stories so similar yet so different in tone. It all comes down to the genius that is Kurosawa. Depicting egoism through embellishment, not just through the verbal tales of the living, but also beyond the grave. Signifying the requirement for flattering falsehood, even when life has been fully exerted. It is the impossibility of human nature that provokes us into fabricating the most obvious details. Never has such an influential film, shrouded in its own classicism, infiltrated my soul through its thematic examination of human psychology as much as this did. Every word. Every detail. Every deadpan look into the camera. Every tracking shot that showcases the glistening sun of truth through the obscurities of darkened natural foliage. It’s perfect. The imperfect gender politics of feudal Japan (“women are naturally weak”) delicately inverted to portray the weakness of humanity, regardless of gender. Utilising the subjectivity of the woodcutter’s perspective, and regarding it as the most truthful conclusive narrative, mankind is objectively weak. And it’s only through our own digressions that we manufacture the strength of the soul. Kurosawa’s symbolic attentiveness never deviated from this examination. His rampart artistry poetically manifesting the beauty of mystery. Invoking the investigative mind of human psychology. And once that overcast storm dissipates, revealing the warm beating rays of honesty, the overwhelming sensation of enlightenment will seep through. A synergistic vitality equalling that of Mifune’s energetic quadruple performance. Each tale altering the personality of his bandit blood. Hysterically laughing at the face of adversity, to unbearably breathing from profuse fear and sin. The nuances are not exhumed just from the enigmatic cast. Kurosawa himself orchestrated a tantalising, influential and innovative mystery that combats the perception of regressive culture. It’s never retrograde nor unprogressive. It is however, and I can utter this with adorned confidence, perfect. Short, sharp and sensational. Relatable on a thematic and personal level that transcends the discourse of time. Apt now as it was back then, only proving that humanity is cemented in deceit and acts of selfishness. As with any Kurosawa feature, the mind must be prepared for allegorical beauty. Rashomon is no different. Rashomon is painted with silky smooth brushes, illustrating an unconventional technique of storytelling through visceral imagery. Rashomon quite simply acquires the perfect rating. An undisputed classic that justifiably conceived, what is now commonly known as, “The Rashomon Effect”.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Thriller', 34), ('Drama', 27), ('Horror', 18), ('Comedy', 11), ('Other', 68)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'In what seems like an endless, almost biblical, rainstorm we meet three people sheltering in the ruins of an old gatehouse.

Despite acknowledging the quality and attention to detail, I can't really enjoy Japanese cinema. Maybe because it's so different from what we have around here. But even being so different, we have to recognize the talent of those who have it. Akira Kurosawa is a director with a sharp eye and detail, who knows how to direct the people under his command and extract from each one what he needs for the film he has in hand. This film seemed to me to be a lot more complicated than it would have been presumed, and I must say that I decided to watch it without knowing very well what I was going to find. Sometimes it feels good to discover something and let yourself be surprised, doesn't it? The story revolves around a crime committed in the middle of the forest, in which a very rich nobleman dies, and the film explores very well the nuances between the versions of the facts, told by various actors. However, the relativity of truth, which Kurosawa ends up defending in his film, I cannot help opposing the precision and absolute reality of the facts. If Kurosawa thinks that there can be several truths around a fact, I personally prefer to defend that there can be several perspectives, several faces of a single truth, factually verifiable. On that point, I disagree with the director. Regardless of my personal disagreements with Kurosawa, we have to recognize the beauty of the script, in its simple writing, but not simplistic, crystalline and clear, but always done in a challenging, philosophical tone. The actors help the director a lot in his eagerness, with great commitment to the ongoing project and high doses of professionalism. Personally, I think I can only highlight Toshiru Mifune, an excellent actor in yet another superb job. The others are just as good, but I don't know them. Technically, the film is worth it for all the details. The cinematography, in black and white, stands out with an excellent use of light and shadow, and great sharpness. The film takes place in the middle of the forest and knows how to make it mysterious, yet fascinating, and the settings are magnificent in their detail.

As well, I heartily recommend viewers to watch all of the extras on The Criterion Collection's recent release--I loved Scola's statement (and I paraphrase): 'Humour is as much a part of life as everything else--If a writer has a chance to put a comedic incident in a realistic drama, he has a moral obligation to do so.' I will remember that--and hopefully utilize it in my own work, should I ever be so gifted as to work in the field that I love--for the rest of my days. I am surprised that it wasn't mentioned in any of the extras that Mastroianni was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance here. That is extremely rare for a foreign-language film, and should instantly be a clue to you of the film's quality. In Loren's June 2015 interview, she stated it was her best work other than her Oscar-winning acting in 'Two Women'. She's absolutely spot-on--and still looking gorgeous today. Definitely worth a purchase and rewatching. It's one of the most poignant observations of loneliness I have yet seen. When Loren's Antonietta says to Mastroianni's Gabriele 'I love you just as you are', it really doesn't matter what eventually happens to either party--Gabriele has found unconditional love. There is truly nothing else worth having, not even life. It should have been called 'A Very Special Day', for it most certainly is, especially for the cinephile who watches it, even now.

This is basically a sequel to the 1956 film and even includes footage from that classic sci-fi/horror. The creature is unconventional to say the least and this adds an eerie component to an already otherworldly and confined Antarctic setting. There are no females and therefore no romantic complications. The characters are thin so the story focuses on the thing and how the crew tries to track it down and eliminate it, if they can.

The people were not really ready for it, but it was. Not only did Spielberg’s friendly and warm-hearted E.T. - The Extraterrestrial debut at Cannes, and went on to become the world’s highest grossing film, but Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan made justice with a really good motion picture to the Star Trek TV series, and Liquid Sky shook up the indie cinema scene. And, of course, the release of John Carpenter’s gruesome, thrilling and tense take on John W. Campbell Jr.’s novella Who Goes There: The Thing, probably named because of the other adaptation of Campbell Jr.’s story, The Thing from Another World (1951). But not only did Carpenter’s The Thing do poorly at the box office, it was also heavily criticized for the raw material (some level of gore and on-screen autopsies of the creature). Almost four decades later, and the movie has gone through one of the biggest re-evaluations in cinema history, becoming a standard bearer for the horror “monster movie” subgenre, and a mandatory stop for cinephiles all over the world. How does a day make a difference. One thing is certain: Nowadays, loved or hated, The Thing is still a topic of discussion. As far as this reviewer goes, I stand with the most recent evaluation. The Thing is an example of tension-building through dialogue, while also being a visually striking, fear-provoking monster flick. And, in the category of alien Sci-fi movies, it is up there with Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Alien (1979) and Predator (1987) in the race for the top spot. The premise of the film, being synthesized, is that a group of norwegian scientists in Antarctica found a 100,000 year old UFO buried in the snow. They find a frozen creature next to it, and thaw it out. The norwegian team proceeds to be almost entirely slaughtered by the unknown beast, that is able to shapeshift into other life forms. A dog, that in reality is the creature, escapes, and is chased all the way to an american base. There, it is unknowingly welcomed, until the Americans investigate the norwegian base. They find about the powers of the Thing, and from there on, the film assumes a “who-do-I-trust” suspenseful setting. The pace is never slow, because the viewer is always on the edge of its seat. The protagonist, R. J. MacReady, is brilliantly portrayed by Kurt Russell, in what would be his third collaboration with John Carpenter. The partnership started with the 1979 TV movie Elvis, and continued with Escape From New York (1981), The Thing (1982), Big Trouble in Little China (1986) and Escape From L.A. (1996). As always, the chemistry between actor and director is important to build up a good result in the form of the film. Here, Russell brings in powerful voice tones, and his characteristic sheer physicality to give his best portrayal of a helicopter pilot who must assume a leading position with his colleagues in order to fight an unknown threat. Amongst the supporting cast, noticeable names are Keith David (They Live), Wilford Brimley (Country) and Donald Moffat (Rachel, Rachel). John Carpenter is almost guaranteed to knock it out of the park when it comes to horror, having The Fog (1980), Halloween (1978), and so many others under his direction. The Thing wouldn’t put him in critic’s graces in 1982, but in the long run, it would define his directorial style, and find its appreciation, being one of the career-defining works that cemented him as one of the authorities on the genre. The soundtrack is beautiful, and that is not for no reason. John Carpenter himself and his long-time collaborator Alan Howarth composed some of the tracks together. The fact that the director himself composes the pieces ensures an extraordinary blend between scene and music. But not only that: for select parts of the score, Carpenter had the compositions of cinematic-music icon, Ennio Morricone. The legendary italian composer made the iconic soundtrack to Sergio Leone’s The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, apart from other big movies like The Untouchables and Death Rides a Horse. And to The Thing, he brought an electronic vibe, in order to approach Carpenter’s own style of music, while also incorporating european elements. The main theme for the film has its own deep meaning, representing the absorption process by the Thing, the main instrument being… An organ. The visual effects were ahead of their time. So ahead of their time, that critics and casual cinemagoers alike bashed them for being “too gruesome” or  “too gross”. There are ways and ways to create fear. One of them is properly scaring people - using jumpscares, or tense and uncomfortable situations -, the other is to gross them out. And The Thing, even though it does scare in the first way really well, relishes in this second one, utilizing the advantage of working with the anatomy of a fictional creature, especially a shapeshifting one, to create horrific settings and on-screen situations. Examples of it are an autopsy of what seems to be a burned human being by the beginning, and the Thing absorbing a few alaskan malamute dogs. The thing about… Uh, The Thing, is that it is one of the early 80s monster flicks that would set the bar high for many others to come. Despite not being well received at its time, it would find deserved recognition after a re-evaluation. It has great attributes such as strong acting, directing, visual effects and a killer soundtrack. In its setting of Antarctica, The Thing delivers proper ice cold chills.

While he\'s presenting his thoughts on what the Thing is, he absent-mindedly taps his pencil eraser on the steaming carcass, crosses his arms and brings the pencil eraser perilously close to his mouth. Then he makes a talking point by waving the pencil in the air and ever so briefly...it touches his lip! Did he infect himself? Is it too late?!?!? Has the Thing spread itself to Blair?!?! These kinds of moments fill the movie. It so suspenseful and so paranoid. And the isolation is torture. You know they all have nowhere to go. All those nameless men. Well, they aren\'t nameless, it\'s just that it\'s hard to remember them all. And the strange thing about it is, we still seem to care about them. I think that\'s because Carpenter has done such a masterful job of building the suspense through threat and isolation that we can\'t help but subconsciously put ourselves into their places. There are so many great scenes. The opening helicopter-chases-dog scene. The horror of finding the Thing in the dog pen. The death and subsequent transformation of Norris. Wow! Is it gory! And in this particular case, I think the gore is absolutely necessary. That\'s kind of the knock on this film. The gore has been classified as extreme. And it is. But this is a story about such a faceless, out-of-this-world beast that it all seems so appropriate. And those effects. I don\'t think I need to say any more than others have already posited about the very special practical effects by Rob Bottin. They have to be the best I\'ve ever seen. Then there\'s the ""blood test"" scene. All of the men at the Antarctic station volunteer to give a blood sample and then have it tested, while tied to chairs, to see if it reveals which of them are actually the ""Thing"". One by one, a heated copper wire is placed into a petri dish of blood from each one of the men. Seeing the smoke rise from the wire when it\'s touched to the dish of blood brings some relief. Will the next dish be Thing-free? You\'ll have to watch it and see for yourself. The setup and execution of this scene is one of the most intense and frightening things I\'ve ever watched. I am very happy that this film has found its place thanks to Home Video. It\'s now considered a Horror/Sci-Fi classic. It is without a doubt my favorite Horror movie, perhaps my favorite monster flick and quite possibly my top Sci-Fi feature.

It is a movie that was made to rely almost entirely on the visuals. It could be said that it is a visual symphony if that makes sense. Thus it was filmed on 70 mm film and in 6 channel stereo which, at the time was a huge thing. Thanks to this it actually made some sense to transfer this movie to Ultra HD Blu-ray since the originals were really good enough even though the movie was made in 1968. I remember watching this movie as a kid and was profoundly disappointed. I thought come on, where’s the adventure, not to mention any form of action? Today I can more appreciate it for what it is. A visually stunning movie. I also can more appreciate the fact that the movie is trying to be scientifically accurate instead of going all out on the fiction part. The parts where gravity, or rather the lack thereof, was portrayed, that was really high tech movie making at the time. I also noticed now, when re-watching it, that all the screens are actually flat which also was really far in the future at the time. Actually it was still pretty much in the future back in 2001. However, even today, I have to say that I find the movie excruciatingly boring. It is two and a half hour long and it moves very, very slowly. It takes 50 minutes of movie time before we actually get to the main part of the movie and get onto the Discovery for instance. No matter how great the visuals are, there’s only so much boredom I can stand before it starts to get to me. In the last 30 minutes or so the movie starts to become very psychedelic. The part where Bowman is pulled into the vortex, the stargate, is going on forever and in the end it just becomes a blur of headache inducing color effects. The final parts of the movie with the three Bowmans of different ages is just weird. So,as this is a non-professional and personal take on the movie I cannot really motivate more than 3 out of 5 stars. I hadn’t actually planned to review this movie. Everything has really already been said about it but I could not refrain after having read this crap at Rotten Tomatoes: Critics Consensus: One of the most influential of all sci-fi films — and one of the most controversial — Stanley Kubrick’s 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity — and folly — of mankind. It’s pretty well known that Rotten Tomatoes is the absolutely worst movie rating site around and the so called “critics” are useless culture elite morons with an over-inflated opinion about themselves at best and politically motivated SJW asswipes at worst but still. What the hell is controversial about it? Reality check, there’s really nothing controversial about it at all. It is just a fictional story in the future. Then we have that crap “the folly”. What bloody folly? If anything the movie shows a much better future  than what we got. A future where the politicians apparently promoted advancement of science and space exploration which is the direct opposite to the money and oxygen wasters we have today. Sure, if you indulge too much in smoking funny mushrooms or are politically motivated you can probably “interpret” the hell out of any movie and “find” whatever message you want but it is still bullshit.

William Sylvester plays an official of US Astronautics in the first hour while Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood play the two functioning astronauts in the second half. Created by Stanley Kubrick (director/writer) and Arthur C. Clarke (writer), ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) is an artistic sci-fi film about human evolution, advanced technology, the wonders of space, the routineness of space travel, artificial intelligence and the mystery of extraterrestrial life. It mixes elements of “Planet of the Apes,” which debuted over six weeks earlier, with aspects of “Star Trek: The Motion Picture,” which came out eleven years later and was obviously influenced by this one-of-a-kind movie. It begins with the “dawn of man” as a curious introduction before jumping forward to the 21st Century, which has been called the longest flash-forward in cinematic history. The depictions of space travel and life-in-space feel wholly authentic. But “2001” is peculiar in that it rejects traditional techniques of narrative cinema and is often a nonverbal experience, which leaves some viewers in awe and others bored. It’s not about conventional thrills, but rather disquieting awe. It’s not easy entertainment, but meditative, transcendent art. The 1985 sequel, “2010: The Year We Make Contact,” is more standard and less ambiguous yet a worthy companion piece. The soundtrack mixes classical compositions, e.g. “Also Sprach Zarathustra” by Richard Strauss, with four creepy modernistic compositions by György Ligeti. The parts of the movie that utilize the latter pieces really evoke an unsettling sense of the unknown. My favorite part is the astronauts’ exchange with HAL, which involves almost an hour of the runtime and is the only part of the film that generates a low-key sense of suspense. Personally, I don’t believe that humankind began as apes (rolling my eyes). But, even if this were true, where did the apes come from? Did they just spontaneously manifest by accident? If so, when? How? Biogenesis is a scientific axiom meaning “life proceeds from life.” So what life form originally created the apes or the simple organisms that supposedly evolved into apes?

Stanley Kubrick is, for me, one of those directors who so quickly impresses us with a great film, as it makes us doubt his competence with an absolutely pathetic trash. I know that the director's fans are going to crucify me, but that's how I think, and I even say more: with each Kubrick film I see, I am more convinced that an aura of unjustified “cult” genius has been created around him. I loved some of his movies like “Spartacus”, “Dr. Strangelove”, “Shining” and “Eyes Wide Shut”, but thinking about them and trying to compare them with “Clockwork Orange” and “Full Metal Jacket” is strange. They don't look like the work of the same director. Released in the 1960s, at a time when the space race was at its height and when the future of Humanity seemed, more and more, to be outside our planet, the film addresses the question of the evolution of the human species in a “sui generis” way: it starts with monkeys and goes to the first contacts with extraterrestrial beings. The film was considered one of the defining milestones of sci-fi as a cinematographic genre, and I believe that this is indisputable. It's also one of the rare sci-fi movies that seems concerned with being scientifically credible, yet not without flaws that a good scientist will spot (and we might not). Set in a hypothetical future, the film shows what space explorations and life in colonies made in space and on the Moon would be like. However, it is still ironic that, after the 60s and 70s, space exploration has been so secondary that many questions, even today, whether we really should spend industrial amounts of money and resources on it. The future that Kubrick imagined in 2001 seems, in 2022, even more imaginative and far from happening than when the film was released. However, some things really did happen and are, today, normal: this is the case of video calls and the extraordinary advances in robotics and artificial intelligence. Among the various merits of this film, we have to highlight the extraordinary visual beauty, the way the director worked with the visual and special effects and the excellent camera work. At a time when CGI was a mirage far from a filmmaker's mind, this film gives us images and visuals that look like they were made this year. The film simply hasn't aged a single day: we have clear images, magnificently crafted light and details, excellent sound effects, a cinematography that makes envy to many 21st century films and, also important, a magnificent soundtrack where “Blue Danube” and “Also Sprach Zarathustra” stand out, helping to popularize these melodies. Despite these indisputable merits, I think this film deserves to be on the list of the most overrated films I've ever seen. And this is due, in good part, to everything else that I didn't say, and which is essential in a good film. Let's start with the absence of a script and horrible pace: for almost three hours, the film drags on unbearably in scenes of great beauty, but with nothing to say. It's truly exasperating. The only moments where the film really gains interest are when the ship's supercomputer turns against the astronauts, and even that segment feels loose, as if the script were a patchwork quilt. The allusions to aliens didn't fascinate me either, it's a regular cliché when making a movie set in space. One point that also didn't help is the lack of good actors, or any decent work for them to do, and the fact that Kubrick shows us life on the space stations as if it were a stay in a luxury hotel. And what about the extraordinary sense of arrogant conceit that the film conveys? We are the ones who have to recognize if the film is good, it can't be the film telling us that every minute!"", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'JJJ222cool', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'Absolute classic, must see, one of the best scifi movies ever made', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 2), ('Science Fiction', 2), ('Mystery', 2), ('Comedy', 1), ('Other', 1)]}, {'writer': 'James', 'score': '80%', 'review': 'This is the most pretentious crap ever made - but is it an amazing film?

Wow, that was a different take on Pinocchio indeed. Pinocchio, the original, is not surprisingly, one of the movies I watched as a kid and which is quite dear to me. A movie from the time when the name Disney actually meant something and when they made actual family movies instead of woke crud for the small but loud-mouthed and fanatical minority. Needless to say I have not even contemplated to watch Disney’s latest remake of the original. But then, Guillermo del Toro movies I often like and, well, the kids (who are also very anti-woke) wanted to watch it so I did not have much choice but to watch it. I do indeed have some reservations about the theme used in the movie but overall it was a good movie. The movie is more geared towards adults or at least young adults than Disney’s original. It is much more dark and less humorous. But then, with Guillermo del Toro at the helm that is not really a surprise is it? Since I did not know anything about this movie until I started to watch it I sat through the entire movie wondering if it was done with stop-motion figures or CGI made to look like stop-motion. It turnes out that it is indeed stop-motion and damned impressive stop-motion at that. Really well done. The story, which has little to do with the original Disney one to be honest, is not bad but here we come to my main gripe with the movie. I did not really like the setting in fascist Italy with a lot of the movie preaching about fascism. It is really beating a dead horse and it made the movie darker than it had to be. I know Pinocchio is an Italian story so they could not really have set it in communist Russia, even though that would have been much more relevant if they really wanted to have some background bad guys. Still, I just wished they would have found some other theme. The ending is also nothing like the original Disney movie. It is not entirely a tragic ending but it is certainly not an overly happy one either. It is a good ending but, again, more an adult ending than a children’s story ending.

The women adopted the best solution to combat this bigotry, though - they decided there are more ways than one to skin a cat and so let their astonishing talents do their talking for them. Luckily, Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) had a boss in Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) who was essentially a practical and politically motivated man who cared far less about segregation and much more about beating the Soviets into space. His attitude, that swiftly builds into a considerable degree of respect, enabled her to step up and demonstrate she was every bit as good, if not better, than those white men around her - all rather uniformly dressed in white shirts and ties. Across the corridor, the equally adept Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) was fighting her own battle for recognition as the supervisor of a crack team that was charged with installing, programming and validating the workings of a brand new IBM computer. Finally, the triumvirate was made up by Mary Jackson (Janelle Monáe) whose skills were going to be crucial if the heat shield on the module charged with getting the astronaut (Glen Powell) back to Earth safely was going to work properly. Director Theodore Melfi manages to delicately marry these three threads together keeping the story interesting and investing us not just in the struggles of these women but also in the excitement of the practical science unfolding before us.

I've already seen two of Akira Kurosawa's most renowned films and, quite frankly, I still can't understand why this Japanese director is so commonly considered a cinematic genius. His films are quite good, they're meticulous, there's a lot of attention to detail, but they're not particularly unforgettable… that's what I think. This film is an adaptation of the plot of “King Lear”, by Shakespeare: a warlord, in the middle of the Japanese feudal era, decides to withdraw and divide his lands, power and castles among his three sons. Only one of them disagrees and warns him that it is highly unlikely that they will stay together as brothers, which provokes the old father's wrath. However, the future proves true for the younger son's words when the two older brothers despise their father and conflicts begin. Driven mad and accompanied only by a fool, the old man ends up mad while the brothers fight each other. I won't talk about the cast because I don't know these actors. I can only say that they worked well, within the context and the type of film we are talking about. There is an excessive stylization, both in terms of interpretation and in terms of dialogues, which sounds theatrical, forced, but I don't know if that was on purpose. On a technical level, the film has a lot of points in its favor, starting with an excellent cinematography, very colorful and with good lighting. The sets are superb, in particular the castles, recreated to the smallest detail, and the costumes are also good, beautiful and historically credible. I don't think I'll be being unfair if I say that this film probably has some of the best war scenes in period films set in Japan. There is no CGI, special effects have been used judiciously, and the war has been recreated to be as authentic as possible, with hundreds of extras dressed to the nines and a lot of effort on the part of the production. For a historian, you can't ask for more. The big problem with this movie is that it wasn't made to entertain but to make you think, and it's full of scenes and sequences designed to make the viewer think about what they're watching. It's something that would work, if it weren't sometimes overly cryptic. The audience needs to understand what the director wants to convey, and that often doesn't happen. Furthermore, it is a film that does not spare the audience: it starts very well, it ends very well, but everything in between is unbearably prolonged and distended. What could be said or done in two minutes is done in five minutes, and there are a lot of dialogues and scenes that don't seem to have any function other than to make the film take longer."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}]",100,Yes!

After that he got adopted from an Australian family and the rest of the film revolved on his true identity. Haunted by his past, how he rediscovered his originality was emotionally told. Very impressive film. The families should not miss it. Even though it is a must see by all ages. I am not a big fan of Dev's performances, even in his debut film 'Slumdog Millionaire'. After that success, he had survived in the film industry doing decent roles, for like a decade. But it was 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' that changed his career.

This film, for me, has one big point for it and one big point against it. The point in its favor is that it is consistently based on a true story, and as far as I can tell it has been relatively faithful to events. The downside is the fact that it is one of those films that constantly appeals to the public's emotions in order to have some ability to capture our attention. It's not particularly pleasant having to watch a movie that almost forces you to have a box of Kleenex next to you from start to finish. The script tells the story of an Indian child, very poor, who likes to play with his brother by the train tracks. It so happens that, one day, things go really wrong and Saroo – that's the child's name – ends up trapped in a train that starts moving, taking him to new places, and separating him from his brother and family. Lost, not knowing how to get back in touch, he ends up in an orphanage. There, he will be adopted by an Australian couple, and raised with all the sweetness. But he never forgets his mother and, as an adult, he decides to return to India to find her. After the success of “Slumdog Millionaire”, it seems that Western cinema is permeable and open to what is best done in Bollywood. This film is not Indian, but it has actors of Indian origin and was well received, with good reviews and a good box office. The film “cleaned up” the Australian film awards and won some BAFTA awards, but lost the Oscars for which it had been nominated and was categorically ignored by the Golden Globes. By the way, while we're at it, it's quite difficult to understand how Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman – the film's protagonists and its main actors – ended up being nominated for Oscars in the Supporting Actor/Actress categories! The only reason I see for this “disqualification” is a possible attempt not to put them on the path of “favorites” to the two figurines, namely Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone and Casey Affleck. In any case, the film was one of the “losers” of that year's Oscars. The film is solidly starred by Dev Patel, an actor who thus consolidates his status as an international star and who guarantees him a place, if he wants, in American cinema. He only appears near the middle of the film because the story begins in the character's childhood, yet he didn't hesitate and confidently embraced his character with charisma and talent. For her part, Nicole Kidman also does not miss the opportunity to do another job very well done. Less interesting, David Wenham and Rooney Mara did what they could with two rather underdeveloped characters. One of the film's problems is its duality: developed in two halves (the first focused on the main character's childhood, and the second on her search for her mother, already in adult life), they are quite different from each other. I'm not going to say which one is the best, I think that's something relative and that says more about the viewer than the work, but I can say that I liked the second one better, even if it seems less coherent than the first one, more solid, but also more melodramatic. In this regard, it is necessary to praise the work of the young Sunny Pawar who, with an interpretation of demanding characteristics in which he shone, sustains a part of the film that, without him, would be much less interesting. Technically, what I most appreciated and feel commended for is the quality of the cinematography, which is clean, sharp, excellently framed and in magnificent colors. The sets and costumes are also very good, and the careful choice of filming locations allows for the inclusion of a beautiful set of landscapes. On this subject, it is worth watching the beginning of this film with attention. The soundtrack and the visual and sound effects complete all this with subtle touches, of great quality."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'Though it’s Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman who take top billing, it’s the hugely engaging Sunny Pawar who steals his scenes here as the young Saroo. He’s growing up in rural India with his elder brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) living fairly hand to mouth with their mother (Khushi Solanki) and so the two set off into the city to try to make some cash. Once they arrive, though, the young Saroo is too tired to accompany his brother on his search for work, so he has a nap! Next thing, he’s on a locked train heading through the countryside and when he does eventually manage to get off, nobody understands him nor has heard of his hometown. That’s just the start of some adventures that illustrate how dangerous this society can be as he encounters some fairly malevolent souls on his travels. None of this is especially graphically portrayed, but you don’t need a very vivid imagination to appreciate just what some had in mind for this five year old boy. Fortune smiles on him, though, and to Australia he goes where he is adopted by Sue (Kidman) and husband John (David Wenham) and now morphs into Dev Patel. He’s happy enough there, moves to Melbourne and meets Lucy (Rooney Mara) but he’s becoming more and more restless. Despite his comfortable life and his love for his adopted parents, he still pines for his family in India - so sets about trying to put together what he knows, remembers and can glean from Google maps. Can he ever find home? Patel is also a natural here and he manages to convey well the struggle between his innate need to find out what happened at home with his obligations to his parents, a challenge made especially difficult as Sue is having issues of her own which are explained here without sinking into melodrama. The latter stages are also effectively intercut with flashbacks that seem to be fuelling his desires to return but also offer us an opportunity to appreciate just how loving this family was, despite them having to pinch coal from the train to trade for milk. Kidman only really appears sparingly but she offers an impassioned and often quite poignant performance - but neither she nor Patel really hit the potency of the young Pawar who really does make this worth a watch.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Comedy', 18), ('Other', 113)]}]",100,Yes!

Total poverty, which has always driven Man to crime, was soon associated with drug trafficking and consumption, and other crimes such as illegal gambling, arms dealing and prostitution, and led to the birth of criminal mafias, heavily armed, which took advantage of the geography and difficulty of entering some of these “favelas” to transform them into fortresses, where not even the regular police dare to enter. Thus, the issue of favelas was, and still is, a serious social, urbanistic and human problem for Brazilian cities. I don't have reliable data, but as far as I know, there is a long way to go to solve issues such as the lack of infrastructure, the lack of security of the land and the construction of houses in unstable lands. I know that measures have been taken to resolve them, and above all to combat crime (the film reveals this, taking advantage of Pope Benedict XVI's visit), but to what extent are they effective? What I can say is that, for now, Rio and São Paulo are off the list of the most dangerous cities in Brazil, but there is much to be done in other cities such as João Pessoa, Fortaleza, São Salvador or Natal. In this film, we follow the journey of two recruits on a course for an elite police force, trained to intervene in the most complicated scenarios: the BOPE. Each is guided by their own reasons, but they are united by a feeling of weariness at the impunity of criminals. The head of the recruit, Captain Nascimento, is also at the center of the plot, as he is discreetly looking for a replacement in order to retire and be able to dedicate the rest of his time to his family, and the little psychological sanity he has left. It is a very raw portrayal of the extremely violent training of these units which, however, prepares them for the authentic urban warfare they have to face. It also lets us foresee a little of the gravity of the problem itself: armie-like bandits who commit brutalities without thinking twice, and a police force that could go to war if needed. With this film, Wagner Moura achieves one of the most outstanding and important works of his career. He was not, until this film, one of the great Brazilian actors, one of those that we always remember when we think of Brazilian drama. However, I had already been appreciating his quality in some TV works he did, and even so, it was quite impressive to see him here. And although the film features other talented actors, such as André Ramiro and Caio Junqueira, it is Moura who stands out and dominates the film. I also liked the work of Fernanda Machado who, in a much more discreet way, shows the somewhat utopian and dreamy way in which upper-class youngsters seek to cultivate a sense of social justice without knowing, however, how to solve the problems at their root. Technically, the film stands out for its enormous realism. It's a work of fiction, the characters and situations are invented, but everything was thought to seem true and authentic as in a documentary. We observe this, for example, in the enormous amount of profanity and slang used in the dialogues, or in the careful selection of the filming locations used, which include some “favelas” in Rio. Another point of praise is the quality of the action scenes, worthy of a big-budget American film and filled with good special effects and sound. It is a film inappropriate for children or to watch with that narrow-minded granny, but very good, one of the best films that Brazil managed to export internationally."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'Abrazilliancheeze', 'score': 'N/A', 'review': ""As a brazilian, i can approve this movie as relatable As a brazilian, this movie i can agree with.

Treves (Hopkins) tries to help Merrick (John Hurt) for the last six years of the latter’s life wherein he becomes cultured, but he inevitably remains an object of curiosity, to high society as well as low society. Anne Bancroft plays a winsome entertainer who is warm toward Merrick. Directed by David Lynch and shot in B&W, “The Elephant Man” (1980) is a melancholic biographical movie, and understandably so, but Merrick’s story is worth checking out despite the fact that it inspires pity. It calls into question the concept of beauty: Natural beauty is something one is born with and did nothing to acquire, but so is physical unattractiveness. Then there’s inner beauty. The charismatic actress (Bancroft) displays both. Of course there’s also inner ugliness, like the carnival huckster. A myth developed about Merrick’s disfigurement that his mother was raped by an elephant, probably started by sideshow hawkers. The opening conveys this in an artistic manner, but it’s not to be taken literally, which is why it’s surreal. Meanwhile the factory scenes with the pipes and corresponding dangers exhibit the reality for workers in Victorian times. The score by John Morris is noteworthy with one piece being ripped-off for the moving parts of “Platoon” (1986), e.g. Elias’ melodramatic death scene.

Set in 1932 in a fictional country called Zubrowka, the streets, military regalia and (ersatz) German names we are shown could have come from anywhere between Germany and Estonia. Its protagonist Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) is a concierge at the eponymous luxury hotel, the splendour of which disappeared, we are told, with World War II. Gustave H. is known publicly as one of the best concierges in the business, able to dash around the hotel at lightning speed to satisfy the most varied guests of the elite clientele. Privately, he\'s a rake with a rather foul mouth, and fond of bedding the rich old women who patronize the establishment. When one of those old ladies, Madame Céline Villeneuve Desgoffe und Taxis (Tilda Swinton) dies and Gustave is framed for her murder, he must evade the law and unmask the true culprit, with the help of newly hired lobby boy Zero Mustafa (Tony Revolori). The films of Wes Anderson are known for their immense visual detail, and THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is no exception. The elaborate framing of shots, the myriad cute items to look at on every set, and the architectural detail are like a diorama blown up to the big screen. Curiously, that visual detail is matched to a real slackness in the human characterization. Anderson has brought in a large number of actors he had worked with before, including Adrien Brody, Jeff Goldblum, Ed Norton, and Bill Murray, for roles that range from the main villain to little more than cameos. These characters are never fleshed out like Gustave H. or Zero Mustafa, and the actors don\'t even try to pass themselves off as Central Europeans from the entre deux guerres. Instead Adrien Brody plays Adrien Brody, etc. There are two supporting roles that I felt were stronger. William Defoe plays a nearly mute henchman whose look is a nod to early vampire films (Transylvania was Central Europe, too). More remarkable is Harvey Keitel\'s turn as an old prisoner: when so many handsome leading men try to hide the effects of time after they enter their sunset years, 75-year-old Keitel was not afraid to show the ravages of old age here. Unfortunately, I found the 21st-century Americans strutting about (and a few speaking in rough New York accents) in a historical drama to be jarring. I was also disappointed by the resort to Hollywood tropes here, when Anderson\'s earlier films managed to be very quirky and sui generis. For example, did we really need not just one scene where a character is hanging off a cliff\'s edge as the villain stands over him, but two? And the amount of plot details that are introduced but never really explained makes one feel that the work was subject to some heavy cuts to please a studio. Still, if you liked Wes Anderson\'s earlier films, you\'ll find much to enjoy in his dollhouse approach, and it is amazing how every one of his films has a completely new and fresh visual theming even if his quasi-autistic obsession with prettiness never changes. Another thing I liked about the film is its ""story within a story within a story"". The entire plot of Gustave H. is, we are shown, taken from a fictionalized treatment by a writer who met a middle-aged Mustafa (F. Murray Abraham) in the 1960s. Befitting this novelistic layer -- and the work of Stefan Zweig that Anderson credits for inspiration -- this framing story is written in stilted, unrealistic dialogue like an old-time novel. And the aspect ratio changes for each layer of the film, a little treat for cinema anoraks.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 78), ('Comedy', 27), ('Romance', 22), ('Documentary', 13), ('Other', 53)]}]",100,Yes!

Have I really watched a South American movie! This is not a doubt over the culture or the language the movie was rendered, but the basic plot was universally appealing. Wherever from you are, this story will look very familiar, you know the master-servant theme with jealous, dominance and other differences between them which intrigued after some unexpected incident. Don\'t assume it is a revenge flick, but a closer look at the daily life of a servant. It is a beautiful drama filled with some occasional dark humours. Frankly, I did not expect it to be this good after I heard it failed to make into the Academy Awards. Yep, this was Brasil\'s submission for the 2016\'s Oscars. A story of a live-in housemaid called Val. She opted this life to be apart from her daughter Jessica only to provide a better life for her. But things change, once Jessica decides to come and stay with her mother to apply for a college in Sao Paulo. That brings a complete chaos in the household due to the generation and the professional gap. It was a casual opening, like Val was doing her daily routine. This was a very calm part, the story that introduced everything without complicating, especially keeping in mind the second half narration. The movie also digs every detail very closely, like how a maid behaves when her owner is not around, individual relationship with everyone in the house including the other maids and their personal desires. ""She looks at everything. Looks like the president."" Believe me, if you ever had one, probably you begin to think them now by remembering any strange incidents from the past like what might be the truth. It is not like accusing them for something, but you know, sometimes we forget we\'re the same other than a thin line between us called the social status. That\'s where this film hits you hard and makes you feel regret if you have ever done anything wrong without knowing. It was not like any other similar movies I have seen. There was only a small deviation, that\'s what it makes a special. Also, it was not completely a realistic boring drama if you\'re wondering about the pace. It was a steady tempo, but had the sufficient entertaining content, often makes us to guess the next scene and besides it had a tiny twist at the end. It was not a strong ending as one could have wanted, but it\'s the best one after the story took a turn in the final act. I don\'t know the cast or the crew, but the direction was top notch alongside the cast performances. Thankfully, it was not another sentimental drama with a struggling servant or the questionable relationship between a mother and her daughter. Very much within our perception like you know all this, but seeing it for the first time. The balance between everything was the best of it. Almost 80% of the movie were shot in a single location/house and a few outside clips as the story demanded. The Oscars might have rejected it, because there\'s only five slot and they found better five to fill the spot, but that should not be the reason you to skip this heartwarming movie from the country that hosting the next Olympic games. I feel this film is this year\'s \'Ida\', unlike a nun\'s self-discovery before taking oath to the god, here a maid realises her mistakes and not being a good mother to her daughter which leads her to fix it by not repeating it. A movie that should be watched with the family, inviting housekeeper for the watch might help bond well.

It\'s essentially a thoroughly potent story of revenge, but it\'s as much about just how that can become a toxic influence that can eat into a man\'s soul and the challenge for ""Dantès"" and those around him whom he loves - however unwillingly on the surface - is not to become an obsessed demon every bit as ghastly as those he wishes to punish. It\'s this slow, dripping, evolution that the film delivers enthrallingly as we see this troubled man tread an increasingly conflicted line between love and hate.

Directed by Jacques Bernard, this latest French interpretation is nothing short of spellbinding, with Pierre Niney delivering a portrayal of Edmond Dantès that feels both deeply authentic and timeless. From Dantès’ naive beginnings to his calculated, unrelenting vengeance, Niney embodies the role with a level of intensity and depth that captivates from the very first scene. Visually, the film is breathtaking. The cinematography paints each setting—from the claustrophobic depths of Château d'If to the grandeur of Parisian society—in vivid, atmospheric detail. Every shot feels like a piece of art, masterfully capturing both the story’s drama and its rich historical backdrop. The film’s use of real locations transports viewers to the story’s world, making each moment feel hauntingly real, a rare achievement in period cinema. Adding to the experience is a lush, evocative score that amplifies the film’s emotional power. The music captures Dantès' inner turmoil and triumph with remarkable sensitivity, lending every high-stakes scene an added layer of tension. It’s a soundtrack that will stay with you long after leaving the theater, a perfect companion to Dumas' tale of betrayal and redemption. The film’s costumes, masks, and makeup are absolutely spectacular. Every detail—whether the intricate designs of Dantès' masquerade attire or the worn expressions on characters weathered by hardship—feels perfectly tailored to the time period. The masks, in particular, add an air of intrigue, shrouding key characters in mystery and creating a rich visual metaphor for the story’s themes of deception and disguise. At a generous three hours, The Count of Monte Cristo thoroughly explores Dantès' journey, though I found myself wishing it were even longer. An adaptation of this depth and quality could have easily been extended to a two-part epic, much like last year’s exquisite French rendition of The Three Musketeers, with an expanded runtime of four or five hours to fully savor each intricate turn of Dantès' revenge. In every respect, this 2024 version is a masterpiece and, without a doubt, the definitive Monte Cristo for a modern audience. It balances faithfulness to Dumas' original with bold, cinematic flair, capturing the story's essence in a way that is grand, poignant, and unforgettable. This is a film that will surely stand the test of time."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 16), ('Action', 7), ('History', 7), ('Thriller', 6), ('Other', 55)]}]",100,Yes! Looking good!

He manages to convey to an audience the absolute sense of anguish and the sheer determination of these men as tragedy ensues and their priorities and perspectives take a jolt that would readily set off their cargo.

Did Marty burn out after his Jake LaMotta bio, the same way Coppola did afterApocalypse Now? These were risky movies, driven by passion, bordering on madness. Did Marty and Francis lose their natural passion for making films because industry priorities dismissed 70\'s-style hyper-realism for sensational summer blockbusters and CGI spectacles? And why is Scorcese considered one of the greatest director when he really only made one truly superb movie? When I first sawRaging Bullin 1980 I immediately knew I was watching something that transcended the typical cinematic experience. Genius was shimmering out of every perforated frame flickering on the screen. Paul, Marty, Bobby, Mike and Thelma created something that was completely absorbing. The style and substance was perfectly fueled by a flawless emotional narrative. Every element was orchestrated just right. The audience was spellbound. We were watching greatness. A rare and unique organic creation. I\'m still waiting for Robert Redford to correct a travesty of justice and hand his Ocscar over to it\'s rightful owner. And I\'m still waiting for Scorcese to match his own brilliance. But that\'s like expecting Tarantino to topPulp Fiction. There\'s a better chance Orson Welles rises up from the dead to one upCitizen Kane. AfterRaging Bull, Scorcese has made a string of pictures ranging from not bad to pretty good. All well-made, thoughtful and meticulously crafted films, but nothing special; certainly nothing profound. Contrary to popular opinion,Goodfellasis not a great movie. I was not swept away by the saga. I was annoyed rather by the fragmented non-stop soundtrack and incessant up-tempo style. Marty wasn\'t risking anything anymore. He seemed to be afraid of boring the audience. Perhaps he was trying to revive the 1940\'s never-let-up screwball-bouncing farcical Preston Sturges and co. comedies. But this is a mafia film. This should have been right up Marty\'s alley. It\'s been almost a quarter of a century since De Niro got his face busted in a boxing ring. Since the raw, robust and naive will-power of LaMotta\'s youth plunged into the pathetic, brutal, bone-headed stupidity of his later years. Similarly, Scorsese hasn\'t registered a knock-out punch since. Would his ensuing movies be considered great if someone else directed them? Would I have liked them all better if Raging Bull had never been made? The Wolf of Wall Streetis another exhausting affair. It tries too hard to excite and entertain us. It\'s afraid of slowing down, allowing us to ponder or examine the complexities of excessive greed, shameless wealth and unbridled capitalism. It desperately wants to arouse us. Like a neglected clown at a child\'s birthday trying to be loved and taken seriously while draining the life out of the party. Give Leo and Jonah an ""A"" for effort. They couldn\'t have tried harder if they broke out into song and dance every ten minutes. And they convincingly appeared to enjoy themselves freely indulging in coke, ludes and naked women every five minutes. It was nice of Leo to step back while Margot Robbie took her routine and obligatory, supporting-actress hissy fit. And you know a filmmaker has a lot of faith and confidence in his work when a superfluous narration track is added, to plug those terrifying noiseless gaps. Whatever happened to poignant, suspenseful, sure-footed, gripping, emotionally-arresting dramas that take you on a nervy, wild ride to a thoroughly gratifying climax?

There are many films about con artists and confidence games (Ocean’s Eleven and its two or three sequels, for example), but I had never seen one that was so good-natured and in which the main characters were so likable. It's a light, family comedy from the 70s, in which a group of tricksters decides to risk their lives to deceive a powerful and rich mobster in order to avenge a friend, killed by his hitmen. This film was, at the time, a huge financial success in the USA and won notable awards, especially seven Academy Awards: Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Soundtrack, Best Original Screenplay, Best Costume Design, Best Editing and Best Art Direction! Therefore, it is difficult to believe that a film with such qualities has been forgotten, but it is true. I never saw it on television, I never heard much about it, I don't think it even had much visibility outside his country of origin. In Portugal there wasn't, but I understand why: the film premiered the day before the country experienced a military coup against the government, and the rest of that year was very complicated here, so no one was very willing to go to the movies. Therefore, I think that recapping this film and bringing it back to theater, in a possibly restored version, would be a gesture of complete justice to its quality. The film has three enormous actors who deserve praise for the work done here: Robert Redford shows value and talent in a film that will open many doors for him, Robert Shaw offers us one of the best dramatic exercises of his artistic maturity and Paul Newman shines and enchants us in the role of an elegant and friendly swindler full of tricks. Seeing these three great actors together on stage is simply delightful. The film also has a good secondary cast, with Robert Earl Jones, Charles Durning, Eileen Brennan, Ray Walston and other good artists. On a technical level, we have to surrender to the impeccable cinematography achieved by the meticulous eye of director George Roy Hill, in cooperation with a team of good professionals, and which perfectly emulates old films from the 30s with the advantage of color, in tones deliberately brownish, golden and yellowish. The sets, props and costumes are simply incredible: the cars can make classic admirers salivate and the costumes deserve a place in the closet of any gentleman with a taste for the “old-style” elegance they exude. The period is well recreated and the situations balance dramatic tension and humor well. The soundtrack is solidly based on Scott Joplin's piano melodies and is wonderful to listen to, and the titles are magnificently well-designed and have art in themselves.

With “Simone” now on quite an obviously self-destructive path, “Rocco” - himself now a distinguished boxer after his time in the army disgusted by his brother, and “Nadia” loathing just about everyone - including herself, things become more and more toxic for the “Parondi” family. It’s that toxicity that Luchino Visconti captures evocatively as this characterful story develops along lines that are anything but predictable. Sure there is vengeance, but it’s exercised in such a subtle and accumulating manner as to provide us with a denouement that proves entirely unsatisfactory but somehow entirely appropriate. It’s Salvatori who steals this for me, but Girardot also shines as does Paxinou as the epitome of the Italian mother whose character is largely responsible for some of the sparing but punchy histrionic humour that peppers this family drama. The setting of a nation still recovering from the ravages of war, with money tight and opportunities unevenly spread throughout the place tells us potently of the trials and tribulations of relocation and of fitting-in as much as anything else, and some of the monochrome photography contrasts just as strikingly their slum dwellings with the more beautiful architecture of Milan suggesting that even there, there are rags and riches stories to be told and perhaps even to anticipate too. As in so many stories, boxing is used effectively as not just a conduit for hope, but also one for hatred and ambition and it’s with this persona that Delon is at his most effective as his increasingly conflicted and decent “Rocco” finds life nigh on impossible. The final segment falls to the impressionable young “Luca” who might feel just a little short-changed, but who might also prove to be the one most affected and with the most to look forward to. It’s vibrant, angry, clever and possibly my favourite Visconti film and if you can sit for a few hours and watch it on a big screen, then it’s well worth the effort.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Romance', 18), ('Other', 113)]}]",100,Yes!

Murray Abraham) is a competent but mediocre composer in Vienna, Austria, in the late 1700s. He recognizes the God-given genius of the younger Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) and struggles with bitter envy. The story is told in flashback as Salieri shares it with a cleric decades later at an asylum. “Amadeus” (1984) is an entertaining costume drama that successfully takes you back to Vienna from 1783-1791. Mozart was basically the rock star of the era and some of his dynamic music even evokes certain modern rock styles. Giving the main characters personality helps bring the events alive and the flashback structure makes for compelling storytelling. On the feminine front, Elizabeth Berridge plays Amadeus’ cute & feisty wife, Constanze, while Christine Ebersole is on hand as a ravishing opera singer, sorta reminiscent of Tina Root of Switchblade Symphony (albeit taller). The original Broadway play concentrated on character motivation with music in the background while the movie focuses a little too much on it. Unless you’re an opera aficionado, the extensive scenes of Mozart's and Salieri's operas being performed become tiresome after a while and unnecessarily bloat the film, somewhat muting the story. When the Emperor yawns during a performance of “Figaro” I could relate because a lot of opera music sounds the same to me. Nonetheless, this is an informative and amusing biography of Wolfgang’s last nine years; very well done. The movie runs 2 hours, 40 minutes and was shot mostly in the Czech Republic.

Murray Abraham in this masterfully crafted - if entirely speculative - retrospective on the life and times of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (portrayed here by the astonishingly effective Tom Hulce). Abraham portrays the duplicitous, envious and malevolent Antonio Salieri, the court composer to Emperor Joseph II of Austria (Jeffery Jones). He is talented, up to point, and settled in his politically influential and wealthy role, but growing up, he has always been aware of this other young boy who can play, perfectly, composing as he goes. Initially in awe of this man\'s predigious talent, it isn\'t long before the green eyed monster starts to rear it\'s ugly head, and jealousy soon starts to drive his every waking moment. Meantime, the young maestro is attracting more and more attention, acclaim and is soon rivalling Salieri for the attentions of the Emperor himself. At this stage, Salieri must act. How? Well fortunately he is ably assisted by Mozart\'s own self-destructive character. As a child, compared to a performing monkey, he always had issues with his father (Roy Dotrice) and even when married to Stanzi (Elizabeth Berridge) with his own child, we feel that he is always in search of adulation, appreciation and love whilst treading a very fine line between despair and a chronic fear of poverty and failure - one which leads him to an increasingly addictive existence. What is also striking here, is the extent to which Mozart\'s music has become pervasive in not just cinema history, but in our broader environment too. I found myself familiar - to varying degrees - with much of the superbly delivered soundtrack. It\'s all told via a rather apposite ""confession"" between Salieri and a priest who, as the story develops, struggles with his own faith and his belief that all sins can be forgiven. Perhaps some can\'t? The attention to detail here is fantastic: the sets, costumes and the location photography contribute hugely to the wonderfully rich look and feel of a film that just oozes style and confidence. Hulce\'s portrayal of the creative virtuoso as he descends into a maelstrom of misery is thoroughly convincing, and by the end - historical fact being adhered to, at least in this - I felt emotionally drained by the strength of these two tours de forces. A big screen with big sound is a must here, and I think you will find the three hours that this lasts will just fly by.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Comedy', 18), ('Other', 113)]}]",100,Yes!

Middle tier Hitchcock it may be, by his own admission, but it\'s still one of the finest mystery thrillers around. Ray Milland plays Tony Wendice, a former tennis player married to Grace Kelly\'s Margot, who is the source of his wealth. Fearing his lifestyle is about to come to an end due to her dalliances with American mystery writer, Mark Halliday (Robert Cummins), Tony hatches a plan to have her murdered by an old acquaintance whom he has over a barrel with blackmail. However, the plan backfires and a whole new strategy is needed to save Tony from suspicion. Based on the popular and successful play by Frederick Knott (who adapts for the screenplay here), Dial M For Murder was a film Hitchcock had little time for. In fact, having already started work on Rear Window, Hitch treated Dial M For Murder as a jobbing assignment. His mood was further darkened by Jack Warner\'s insistence that the film be shot in 3D, with all the camera restraints that such a production brings. Perhaps unsurprisingly though, the restraints and general mood of the director brought about very pleasing results. Choosing to go for a claustrophobic single set shoot, Hitchcock resisted the urge to launch things around for 3D effects, instead he used the process to highlight props and angles of the Wendice home. His use of colours here first rate, particularly around his new found favourite actress, Grace Kelly. Having never seen the 3D version (who has I wonder?) I can\'t say what impact, if any, the gimmick had. But regardless of Hitch\'s grumblings and general disdain towards the film, he rose to the challenge by challenging himself and actually produced a fine and technically sound picture. Ray Milland is icy cold yet debonair, while John Williams as Chief Inspector Hubbard strides in and walks off with the film. Kelly is adequate enough, it\'s her least effective turn for Hitch, so early in her career, she was a bit free with her physical love on the set (source ""A Life in Darkness and Light""), but this highly appealed to (and amused) Hitch and he of course would use her for better rewards post this production. Sadly Cummings is awfully bland and threatens to lose the film momentum when things start to spice up in the last quarter. Hugely entertaining picture though, one that is ripe with characterisations and of much interest to Hitchcock purists in how he works around the 3D format for his own filmic senses, Dial M For Murder holds up well today as a disquieting mystery thriller. 8/10', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 43), ('Thriller', 42), ('Crime', 34), ('Action', 29), ('Other', 111)]}, {'writer': 'barrymost', 'score': '70%', 'review': ""Just with a glance at the cast list and the knowledge that it's directed by the legendary film-making genius Alfred Hitchcock, you know it's going to be good.

It might have been better to have written Tony as a chess master than a former tennis star.  It would have been a bit more in keeping with his plots and strategies.  Even the action in the actual murder scene is ""play-like"" - a rather exaggerated initial reaction to being stabbed followed by the more drawn out dying, dying, dead finale.

Soon there is a seemingly senseless act of violence. It isn’t clear to me whether this ‘loose end’ is resolved later on in the film or whether it mainly functions as worldbuilding, for the benefit of the viewer, letting them know how little value human lives have in this place. After the opening credits follow on from this, the film proper begins. We see two men in a train carriage. The face of one is obscured as they are reading the Holy Bible, according to the text on it. We come to know the man with the obscured face as the film unreels. Not really having read any reviews or such like of this film, I wonder if I am the only person to ponder at the end of this man’s journey whether that introduction to him was in earnest or ironic. It’s perhaps hard to tell. After all, Americans see no tension between loving Jesus and loving money, as the ‘prosperity gospel’ theology attests. The main story concerns two independent bounty hunters in America’s frontier, near Mexico. There is uncertainty as to how the two bounty hunters (the film uses the term “bounty killer”) chasing the same bounties will play out. Is conflict inevitable between them? We have a sense of when all this action takes place, as, at a later point in the film, one of the minor characters is part of a humorous scene where we can see the disruptive influence of the recently introduced passenger train service to the region. The early action of the film put in mind video games for me, with how some action games might have small bounties for the player to chase when they first start and increasing in size as the gamer becomes more proficient at taking on their targets and seeks larger rewards to gain better equipment or what have you. As the bounties in the film increase in size, they seem to correlate with “on rails” video games. In other words, I found this film to have more of a sense of linearity to it than its predecessor, “A fistful of dollars”. One of the bounty killers looks familiar for those who have seen “A fistful of dollars”. It’s the character played by Clint Eastwood. So, obviously, there is a physical resemblance of the two characters and perhaps they even dress identically. However, to me they seemed two different characters, as in it’s not the same person. As I mentioned in my review of the earlier film, Eastwood’s character had a playful aspect to him there. In this next film in the sequence, though Eastwood’s character is not exactly humourless, his humour is more wry or sardonic. No, that doesn’t quite capture what I’m wanting to say here. In the first film, ‘Squint’ Eastwood was playful and he shared that quality with at least one other character (I have in mind the ‘hanging around’ scene), whereas in this film Eastwood’s character plays his cards held tightly to his chest. In other words, he is amused by some things but is not letting on to anyone else that he is (I have in mind the scene I mentioned earlier, with the minor character talking about the impact of the introduction of trains on him). Wikipedia mentions these first two films being part of a trilogy: “The dollars trilogy” or “The man with no name trilogy”. Since I don’t find myself considering the Clint Eastwood character in both films that I’ve seen so far to be the same person, I’m leaning towards taking these films as being like “The Cornetto trilogy”, in that they are three unrelated films with the same principle actors and loosely bound together. I have to admit to being totally clueless about this “Cornetto trilogy”, despite having seen the first two: “Shaun of the dead” and “Hot fuzz”. Apparently all three films make passing mention of Cornetto ice creams. That is what makes them a ‘trilogy’. Perhaps Clint Eastwood’s poncho is Sergio Leone’s Cornetto counterpart? Maybe the third film in this ‘trilogy’ will prove me wrong but it doesn’t seem a “trilogy” at the moment like the Star Wars films are. An interesting facet to these first two films of the ‘trilogy’ that I have seen so far is how one is supposed to relate to returning actors. As I’ve said, I’m viewing Clint Eastwood’s characters as being different. Another returning actor is Gian Maria Volonté, who once again plays the principle villain of the piece, although he is clearly a different character in both. He must necessarily, of course, be of the same ethnicity. In any case, we have two archetypes in common for both films: the poncho wearing man with no name and the swarthy villain. An action archetype in both films is a scene with a beating, although the one in the first film was the more brutal, I think. The only other returning actor that I noticed was Joseph Egger. Since this paragraph and below was written a couple of weeks after I started this review, things like this aren’t fresh in my memory, unfortunately. Speaking of men with no name, in this film, ‘Squint’ Eastwood’s character is referred to as “Manco” and it seemed to be an actual name to me. The translation app on my PC translates this variously as “one-armed” (for Spanish and Italian) or “not even” (for Latin). Not sure how good my translation app is but it’s not really clear to me how Clint’s character is “one-armed”. When the film concludes, there is a sort of ‘maybe, kind of, not really’ ambiguity to it. There probably really isn’t, as far as what that character would do in that situation, after retrieving a certain item. It’s just good that the film ends there and you are free to ponder what that character will do with that item. Random notes: I’m scoring this film 75+% (since I don’t round up, the + sign adds an extra star to my rating here). This film has more implausibility to it than the first film which makes it harder for me to get lost in the story. The main way this is demonstrated is how characters interact with each other. I couldn’t believe that Manco would accept a proposition from his rival to do something, as that set off alarm bells for me, as far as possible double-crosses go. Likewise, Manco getting accepted for a heist. Character motivations and actions often just didn’t seem believable to me. Ennio Morricone is credited for the score, unlike in the first film, where, for some reason, he is credited as “Dan Savio”. As far as dramatic music goes, this feels his best score so far, especially effective with the percussive textures during the El Paso bank robbery scene. One thing niggling at me is that I can’t place what other piece of music some parts reminded me of. A few notes perhaps put in mind some 1960’s surf-rock song...maybe something by The Shadows but maybe something else which I can’t recall at the moment (the scene leading up to the bank robbery). A flashback scene has some eerie music. After the robbery scene, I wonder whether I hear the words “Go! Go! Go!” as part of the score...it sort of sounds like words are being used but maybe they’re just meant to be suggestive vocalisations? More toward the start of the film, it sounds like the vocalisations are “We can ride!”. There is an odd mix of childlike depictions of violence (which are perhaps more Classical Hollywood Western in style, although I have not seen too many of these and not since I was a child in any case) and more realistic depictions of the consequences of violence. So, you will see a man fall to the ground after being shot but the shooter’s gun was facing toward the ground, not the victim. And the victim does not bleed. On the other hand, on very rare occasions you will see graphic bullet wounds in freshly made corpses. It therefore seems like a transitional moment in cinema between these two styles...sort of like The Wizard Of Oz was for black/white and colour films, perhaps. There’s a scene where Manco forces an occupant of a hotel room to leave, so that he can have that room for himself. For me, this reflected badly on his character. Architecture...when Indio’s gang enters El Paso, one of the first buildings looks like a prop, as far as the first storey goes. The “Cosmopolitan Theatre” has the UK spelling convention. Of more interest, it looked to me like a heavily secured internal section of the El Paso bank had an unsecured window at its heart...but maybe we can rationalise this by thinking that the bank is as weird as The Overlook Hotel in Kubrick’s film The Shining? One shot of a town’s main street made me wonder if it was shot in a studio, probably due to weather effects. The fight scene between two bounty hunters is very formal, stylised and ritualistic. Not that there’s anything wrong with that!

In any case, it looks pretty harmless!). \\ Print quality: sometimes bits of film seemed to be missing. Maybe you’d see a white patch on Mr. Mortimer’s face.

Soon there is a seemingly senseless act of violence. It isn’t clear to me whether this ‘loose end’ is resolved later on in the film or whether it mainly functions as worldbuilding, for the benefit of the viewer, letting them know how little value human lives have in this place. After the opening credits follow on from this, the film proper begins. We see two men in a train carriage. The face of one is obscured as they are reading the Holy Bible, according to the text on it. We come to know the man with the obscured face as the film unreels. Not really having read any reviews or such like of this film, I wonder if I am the only person to ponder at the end of this man’s journey whether that introduction to him was in earnest or ironic. It’s perhaps hard to tell. After all, Americans see no tension between loving Jesus and loving money, as the ‘prosperity gospel’ theology attests. The main story concerns two independent bounty hunters in America’s frontier, near Mexico. There is uncertainty as to how the two bounty hunters (the film uses the term “bounty killer”) chasing the same bounties will play out. Is conflict inevitable between them? We have a sense of when all this action takes place, as, at a later point in the film, one of the minor characters is part of a humorous scene where we can see the disruptive influence of the recently introduced passenger train service to the region. The early action of the film put in mind video games for me, with how some action games might have small bounties for the player to chase when they first start and increasing in size as the gamer becomes more proficient at taking on their targets and seeks larger rewards to gain better equipment or what have you. As the bounties in the film increase in size, they seem to correlate with “on rails” video games. In other words, I found this film to have more of a sense of linearity to it than its predecessor, “A fistful of dollars”. One of the bounty killers looks familiar for those who have seen “A fistful of dollars”. It’s the character played by Clint Eastwood. So, obviously, there is a physical resemblance of the two characters and perhaps they even dress identically. However, to me they seemed two different characters, as in it’s not the same person. As I mentioned in my review of the earlier film, Eastwood’s character had a playful aspect to him there. In this next film in the sequence, though Eastwood’s character is not exactly humourless, his humour is more wry or sardonic. No, that doesn’t quite capture what I’m wanting to say here. In the first film, ‘Squint’ Eastwood was playful and he shared that quality with at least one other character (I have in mind the ‘hanging around’ scene), whereas in this film Eastwood’s character plays his cards held tightly to his chest. In other words, he is amused by some things but is not letting on to anyone else that he is (I have in mind the scene I mentioned earlier, with the minor character talking about the impact of the introduction of trains on him). Wikipedia mentions these first two films being part of a trilogy: “The dollars trilogy” or “The man with no name trilogy”. Since I don’t find myself considering the Clint Eastwood character in both films that I’ve seen so far to be the same person, I’m leaning towards taking these films as being like “The Cornetto trilogy”, in that they are three unrelated films with the same principle actors and loosely bound together. I have to admit to being totally clueless about this “Cornetto trilogy”, despite having seen the first two: “Shaun of the dead” and “Hot fuzz”. Apparently all three films make passing mention of Cornetto ice creams. That is what makes them a ‘trilogy’. Perhaps Clint Eastwood’s poncho is Sergio Leone’s Cornetto counterpart? Maybe the third film in this ‘trilogy’ will prove me wrong but it doesn’t seem a “trilogy” at the moment like the Star Wars films are. An interesting facet to these first two films of the ‘trilogy’ that I have seen so far is how one is supposed to relate to returning actors. As I’ve said, I’m viewing Clint Eastwood’s characters as being different. Another returning actor is Gian Maria Volonté, who once again plays the principle villain of the piece, although he is clearly a different character in both. He must necessarily, of course, be of the same ethnicity. In any case, we have two archetypes in common for both films: the poncho wearing man with no name and the swarthy villain. An action archetype in both films is a scene with a beating, although the one in the first film was the more brutal, I think. The only other returning actor that I noticed was Joseph Egger. Since this paragraph and below was written a couple of weeks after I started this review, things like this aren’t fresh in my memory, unfortunately. Speaking of men with no name, in this film, ‘Squint’ Eastwood’s character is referred to as “Manco” and it seemed to be an actual name to me. The translation app on my PC translates this variously as “one-armed” (for Spanish and Italian) or “not even” (for Latin). Not sure how good my translation app is but it’s not really clear to me how Clint’s character is “one-armed”. When the film concludes, there is a sort of ‘maybe, kind of, not really’ ambiguity to it. There probably really isn’t, as far as what that character would do in that situation, after retrieving a certain item. It’s just good that the film ends there and you are free to ponder what that character will do with that item. Random notes: ^ I’m scoring this film 75+% (since I don’t round up, the + sign adds an extra star to my rating here). This film has more implausibility to it than the first film which makes it harder for me to get lost in the story. The main way this is demonstrated is how characters interact with each other. I couldn’t believe that Manco would accept a proposition from his rival to do something, as that set off alarm bells for me, as far as possible double-crosses go. Likewise, Manco getting accepted for a heist. Character motivations and actions often just didn’t seem believable to me. ^ Ennio Morricone is credited for the score, unlike in the first film, where, for some reason, he is credited as “Dan Savio”. As far as dramatic music goes, this feels his best score so far, especially effective with the percussive textures during the El Paso bank robbery scene. One thing niggling at me is that I can’t place what other piece of music some parts reminded me of. A few notes perhaps put in mind some 1960’s surf-rock song...maybe something by The Shadows but maybe something else which I can’t recall at the moment (the scene leading up to the bank robbery). A flashback scene has some eerie music. After the robbery scene, I wonder whether I hear the words “Go! Go! Go!” as part of the score...it sort of sounds like words are being used but maybe they’re just meant to be suggestive vocalisations? More toward the start of the film, it sounds like the vocalisations are “We can ride!”. ^ There is an odd mix of childlike depictions of violence (which are perhaps more Classical Hollywood Western in style, although I have not seen too many of these and not since I was a child in any case) and more realistic depictions of the consequences of violence.

What to say about Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream that hasn't been said already? Without doubt it's a film, that in spite of its high standing on the main movie sites, polarises opinions. It's a film that in simple terms follows four people through their addictions until the shattering denouement, but the journey is made more bleak by offering tantalising snatches of hope, the dreams of the protags offered up as some sort of goals for the addicts to cling on to - only for the narrative to stick in its rusty serrated blade to draw the lifeblood from the hapless hopefuls. Arononfsky brings a multitude of technical skills to the party that emphasise the emotional discord on show. Standard split-screening is married up with rapid cutting, isolated framing, close ups, long tracking and Snorricam, all of which is sound tracked by Clint Mansell's haunting musical composition. All told it's an assault on all the senses and terrifying with it, boosted no end by Aronofsky getting top performances from his cast of actors.

The book was written already with Hubert thinking about a movie and had a screenplay for it and approached Aronofsky with it in hands, and Darren rewrote the screen with the help of the writer plus directed the film, being his second official movie after Pi. With a small cast of protagonists Ellen Burstyn (Sara Goldfarb) mother of Jared Leto (Harry Goldfarb), Jennifer Connelly as Marion Silver (Harry girlfriend) and Marlon Wayans as Tyrone C. Love (Harry's friend). It passes in the four stations of one year of 70 to 80's in New York Coney Island district - Sara's son Harry is a drug addicted drop out jew student of high college that constantly sells his mother TV set to pay for various drug including heroin, crack and marihuana, aided by his friend Marlon. He has a, aspiring fashion student addicted as well and share his drugs with her. The plot follows a drug enriched summer through the months each one reflecting the drugs effect from the use, high and withdraw with the seasons, involving also Sara as she is a lonely widow that lives watching shows on television about weighting loss and dreams to be in one. One day she receives a letter saying that she was selected to maybe star on one of those and after failing diet she tries to loose weight with prescribed drugs that induces to addiction as the body arrange itself with the dose. This drama as most of Aronofsky's movie have a very different way of showing up the passing of time and the drugs, into a magnificent and frenetic way as I must say - I am an Aronofsky fan, and at least for me. he is into my top 10 directors/ writers list. The acting of young Leto and Connelly in the start of career are superb and Ellen Burstyn won an Oscar for her performance. It isn't an easy movie to watch but it shows the way drugs act in a realistic way of euphoria in short bursts hip hop sequences and the sudden drastic effect of withdraw as it wrecks the life of the protagonists. Especially towards the end the movie is very heavy to watch, as expected especially at the start of the 2000's. Several cinematography techniques as split screen, timelapses, long shots and close-ups are used, and editing was strenuous\nusing as 4 times more sequences than an usual movie due to the frenetic nature of drug use. As Aronofsky was into the start of his career I suspect he was not indicated to more Academy awards like editing, cinematography and original soundtrack (using string quartet arrangements of Kronos Quartet) written by Pulitzer Prize-winning composer David Lang. Even now, 20 years after the making it is an very enjoyable and a must see movie like the director works to understand how revolutionary it was at the time. It is as important to drug addiction as Kids was to Sex (never watched Trainspotting so I can't correlate). For my an easy 9.5 out of 10.0 / A + and a masterpiece of traditional techniques that is a must see to any cinema lover."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 20), ('Thriller', 19), ('Action', 18), ('Other', 138)]}]",100,Yes!

And thank goodness for that, as evidenced by the profound connection depicted in this delightful animated feature from writer-director Pablo Berger. In a diversely multicultural version of 1980s New York (some might more correctly call it a multi-species zootropolis), Dog is a lonely soul. He longs to find someone to make his life fulfilled, a dream that appears to come true when he purchases an Amica 2000 Robot. Once activated, Robot and Dog quickly bond and spend a fun summer getting to know one another and enjoying each other’s company. But, when a late summer beach outing inadvertently separates them until the following spring, each is left alone, wondering if they’ll ever see one another again, despite often dreaming about what such a reunion may hold. During this separation, though, both parties begin to realize what could occur if they never reconnect, prompting them to consider how to forge new forms of companionship. But will those alternative arrangements be satisfying, or will their longing for one another never let up? These are the kinds of relationship questions that many of us face in life, so the circumstances ring familiar, even if the parties involved are vastly different from us. The result is a warm, touching, heartfelt story that’s decidedly sweet and cute (though never cutesy), with more than a few bittersweet moments to keep it real. The picture’s charming, imaginative animation presents a whimsical, nuanced view of the Big Apple in the late 20th Century with virtually no dialogue but backed with a killer soundtrack. The narrative, based on a graphic novel by Sara Varon, is a bit sluggish at times (especially in the film’s opening half) with some sequences that could have been trimmed or eliminated. In fact, some have contended that “Robot Dreams” is a glorified short that’s been needlessly padded to stretch out its runtime, though that’s a view I don’t share, despite my belief that this release would have benefitted from some judicious editing. As a general rule, I’m not an overly huge fan of animation, since much of it in my mind is excessively silly, manic and inane (especially among American productions), so I tend to pick what I screen in this genre very selectively. However, when animation works well, its offerings frequently turn my head, as this one often does.

We live in dangerous times. In this era of political regression, racists, xenophobes, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, white separatists, and fascists, once confined to the periphery of civilised society, have wormed their way back into the cultural mainstream, preaching hate and intolerance under the guise of terms such as ""nationalism"" and ""patriotism"". Meanwhile, politicians validate such groups by doing precisely nothing to curtail them and refusing to condemn them (""very fine people on both sides"" and so forth). Far-right political parties have gained worrying footholds in numerous European countries, running on populist platforms of Islamophobia and anti-immigration, playing on peoples\' fears of the Other, exploiting the dearth of facts in sociopolitical discourse, and trading in disinformation (and the less said about the current administrations in the US and UK, the better). Anti-establishment political rage is on the increase, as hordes of people disavow traditional centrism; think of Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, theMovimento 5 Stellein Italy, theAlternative für Deutschlandin Germany. Scholars and sociocultural anthropologists have posited that hateful right-wing ideologies are more validated now than at any time since the rise of fascism in places such as Italy in 1922 and Spain in 1936. And the best known example of this kind of fascist thinking, of course, is the Third Reich in Germany, beginning with the rise to power of Adolf Hitler in 1933. And so, it\'s entirely fitting that a film set in this verymilieu, which argues that love, tolerance, and kindness can defeat hateful indoctrination, has come along at this precise moment; because although this is a film set in Germany in 1945, it\'s really about the here and now. Based loosely on the 2004 novelCaging Skiesby Christine Leunens,Jojo Rabbitis a political satire written and directed by New Zealand filmmaker (and Polynesian Jew) Taika Waititi (Eagle vs Shark;What We Do in the Shadows;Hunt for the Wilderpeople;Thor: Ragnarok). Courting significant controversy when it was announced (a comedy about Nazis? For shame. Especially when one considers that the novel is deadly serious) and sharply dividing critics upon release, the film has proven a significant hit with audiences, and has just scored an impressive six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. Positing that the first casualty of indoctrination is objective truth, Waititi follows in the footsteps of filmmakers such as Charlie Chaplin (The Great Dictator), Mel Brooks (The Producers), Roberto Benigni (La vita è bella), and even Quentin Tarantino (Inglorious Basterds), in attempting to defang Nazi ideology by rendering it utterly absurd and mercilessly exposing it to mockery. Marketed as an ""anti-hate satire"", the film has no easy task – to use Nazism as the (mostly) humorous background to what is essentially abildungsroman, without it seeming exploitative or dismissive of the real suffering endured by real people. And Waititi manages this tricky balancing act exceptionally well. The satire and slapstick elements are as funny as anything in his filmography, and the film\'s more serious moments (of which there are several) arrive like an absolute gut-punch. This could have gone wrong in so many ways – if it wasn\'t funny, if the emotionality felt contrived, if the serious moments seemed manipulative, if the whole thing just came across as disrespectful and in bad taste – but Waititi navigates these dangerous waters magnificently.Jojo Rabbitis, in fact, that rarest of films – a comedy where the serious moments feel completely earned and a drama with something important to say where the comedy enhances the seriousness. Großdeutsches Reich, 1945. The European war is all but over. Germany\'s army has been pushed back to the homeland and allied forces are approaching from multiple directions. However, the propaganda machine continues to ensure that the populace are relatively unaware thatDer Führeris on the brink of total defeat. In the fictional town of Falkenhem, ten-year-old Jojo Betzler (an astonishing debut by Roman Griffin Davis) lives with his whimsical mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson doing probably the best work of her career). His father, he believes, is fighting on the Italian Front, whilst his older sister Inge recently died of influenza. And, oh yeah, his imaginary best friend is none other than Hitler himself (a ludicrously over the top Waititi), or at least Jojo\'s childlike conception of Hitler. Believing absolutely in his duty to the state, Jojo and his actual flesh-and-blood friend Yorki (a hilarious Archie Yates) attend a camp for theDeutsches Jungvolkbranch of theHitlerjugend. The camp is run by the cynical Cpt. Klenzendorf (a powerful performance by Sam Rockwell that was outrageously ignored by the Academy), who was forced to leave the front line upon losing an eye. Helping him manage the camp are his effeminate second-in-command Finkel (Alfie Allen) and the completely insane Fräulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson), who claims to have given birth to eighteen blond-haired blue-eyedübermenschenwho are now fighting on the front. When Jojo is told by some older boys that to prove he has what it takes to be a soldier, he has to kill a rabbit, he refuses to do so, earning the moniker Jojo Rabbit. However, determined to show his fellow students what he\'s made of, he barges into aStielhandgranateexercise, tossing a grenade against a tree, which then explodes a few feet away from him, leaving him with a limp and a scarred face, and forcing him to return home in disgrace. As Jojo recovers, Rosie persuades Klenzendorf, who was demoted after the incident, to give him some work, and so he\'s employed to distribute propaganda around town. Life is dull but straightforward. That is until he learns his mother has been hiding a young Jewish girl, Elsa Korr (a nuanced performance from Thomasin McKenzie), in a crawlspace behind the wall of Inge\'s room. However, as every German youth knows, Jews are mind-reading demons who must be exterminated. So why would his mother be harbouring one, and, more importantly, what does Jojo do now that he knows? PerhapsJojo Rabbit\'s most laudable component is how well Waititi balances the disparate tones, which is a hell of a lot better than Benigni did. The film mixes slapstick humour, caricature, satire, dramatic irony, and hope, but never does it seem like its ignoring or trivialising real suffering. When the comedy is dropped and Waititi gets serious, the tonal shifts pack a shocking punch, and it\'sbecausethey\'re so well integrated into the overarching comic structure – if you take away the humour and the satirical edge, the film\'s darker elements simply don\'t work as well – it\'s the contrast that makes each element all the more powerful. Waititi\'s tonal intentions are indicated right from the beginning, as stock footage of German children performing \'Heil Hitlers\' is scored (unashamedly anachronistically) by the German version of The Beatles\' ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" (1963). Also crucially important to the film\'s tonal qualities are the bright, colourful palette employed by director of photography Mihai Mălaimare, Jr. (The Master;A Walk Among the Tombstones;The Hate U Give) and the whimsical production design by Waititi\'s regular designer, Ra Vincent. Together, they speak to the fact that this is Jojo\'s worldview rather than objective reality, with the look of the film reminding me a great deal of Wes Anderson\'sThe Grand Budapest Hotel(2014). It sure doesn\'t look like any World War II movie you\'re ever likely to have seen. Thematically, the film examines multiple issues; the devotion of motherhood, the importance of kindness in defeating indoctrination, the disconnect between an unchallenged and rigidly reinforced ideology and a far more nuanced and complex reality, the predetermined attitudinal stance towards the Other, the clash between doing what one knows to be right and what one is expected to do, the fact that good people can be found even in the worst of circumstances. Klenzendorf\'s arc is especially telling in this respect. Introduced as a hyperbolic caricature, the source of some of the film\'s biggest early laughs, as things progress, we realise there\'s considerably more to his character than initially thought, and he commands what\'s easily the most moving scene in the whole film. This is Jojo\'s story, however, with much of the runtime concerned with his attempts to rationalise the cognitive dissonance between what he\'s been taught and what he can see with his own eyes. Rosie is rightly worried that the indoctrination Jojo has known his entire life has effectively brainwashed him – he\'s so passionately loyal to Nazi ideology, when he found out his grandfather didn\'t have blond hair, it took him three weeks to get over it. Of course, as mentioned, although set in 1945,Jojo Rabbitis really about the here and now, although it\'s more than a little upsetting that its depiction of illogical hate is so timely. Essentially, the film mocks extremism, people who hate based on ethnicity or religion, with Jojo\'s belief that Jews are demonic figures capable of powerful magic standing in for people who believe all Muslims are terrorists or all Mexicans are rapists. In this sense, the film isn\'t about Nazis at all; their role is more allegorical. Rather it\'s partly about the role adults play in inculcating children into hate and partly about exposing the power of propaganda to subvert truth. But so too is it about rising above such ideology, no matter how ingrained it might be, a path that values personal relationships with persecuted minorities, which in turn reveal the individualistic humanity behind the political cliché. And although all of this is presented humorously, it never becomes didactic or monolithically preachy – Waititi balances his tones so well, the political undercurrent remains always subtle. If I were to criticise any element of the film, it would be that Waititi undeniably glosses over some of the more horrific atrocities carried out during the War. The Nazis in the film are, by design, cartoonish, but that is done so as to render them as easily dismissed figures to be scorned. The reality, of course, was far, far darker. I\'ve seen some critics point to this as evidence that the film is crass and manipulative, and although I disagree with that assessment, it certainly wouldn\'t have hurt to have at least one fully indoctrinated Nazi who isn\'t a figure of fun – even the Gestapo is exposed to ridicule, with the character of Deertz (an admittedly hilarious Stephen Merchant cameo) presented as more concerned with empty pop-cultural signifiers than carrying out the actions of the real Gestapo. In this sense, the film doesn\'t represent the awful truth, but it never claims to; this isn\'t a reality-based examination of Nazism, nor does it try to be. Only two weeks into 2020, and I already have a possible film of the year.Jojo Rabbitis beautiful, emotional, heartfelt, and devastating, but mostly hilarious and always hopeful. It\'s an extraordinarily sweet film without ever becoming saccharine, as Waititi strikes a perfect balance between comedy, tragedy, and drama.

Taika Waititi is on a roll recently and rightfully so, because he\'s got a great comedic vision. \'Jojo Rabbit\' is a World War II satire that\'s both hilarious and surprisingly tragic. Joy, terror, love, hate all in one movie. Waititi knows how far to take a joke and how humor can put on light on ugly issues. While absurd looking on the surface, but on a deeper look it\'s something unique. Newcomers Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie take center stage upon the big cast. Their comedic timing, emotional range and overall performances are nothing short than impressive. Also Archie Yates is like the adorable child version of Nick Frost. Speaking of big name stars. Scarlett Johansson is having a fantastic year and she once again delivers a wonderful performance. Sam Rockwell is amazing in pretty much anything he\'s in and here is no different. Rockwell playing a closeted homosexual Nazi is hysterical, and yet meaningful when you look at it more thoughtfully. The weakest actor upon the cast has to be Rebel Wilson. I really didn\'t buy her as this character. I thought she\'s just doing her usual comedic traits like in every other movie, which I\'m not a fan of. Not only is Taika Waititi directing and writing, but also starring as Jojo\'s imaginary friend of his very own idol... Adolf Hitler. Apparently Waititi didn\'t have to research playing Hitler, because he thought Adolf was \'a fing c*\'. Anywhere, the concept itself is really bizarre and really fascinating. While silly and entertaining, but could\'ve been left out, in my opinion. There was a point where he completely disappears from the movie to later reappear during the finale. At times I feel like it tries hard to be like a Wes Anderson movie, in terms of staging, quirky humor, and overall setting.

I saw this film a few months ago, but for whatever reason I didn't remember to write about it until now. Whatever the case, it's one of those films that I wanted to see again, because it's truly good. It's a satire (those politically correct can leave the room now and save their health) in which we follow the journey of a young German who is part of the Hitler Youth. He is truly fanatical about Nazism and has Hitler as his imaginary friend, so he is shocked to discover a Jewish girl inside the roof lining of his house: the boy's mother, in secret, is part of the resistance and helps Jews. We are tired of seeing films about the Second World War, but it is such a remarkable and fascinating moment in our history that they will certainly continue to be an inexhaustible source of inspiration for filmmakers. However, what Taika Waititi offers us is quite different from the ordinary: a deeply satirical and comical film, where we see things through the eyes of a child perfectly deluded by the massive propaganda to which he was subjected, and who receives the first reality check of his young existence. I'm not going to dwell on the way in which Hitler used propaganda to create a legion of fanatical young people and indoctrinate society, I think this has already been covered extensively by many renowned historians and good documentaries. I loved Waititi's light and witty direction, which also brings to life the imaginary Führer that young Jojo has as his friend. The director managed to make a film where good humor does not go beyond the limits, and where there is space for serious things handled with a seriousness that gives depth to the film (this is the case with the way in which the authorities repress dissidents, through visits from Gestapo agents, for example). It's not a dramatic film at all, but it's profound in its own way, and the script creates a good story between the fanatical boy, the mother with a double life and the Jewish girl, who reveals to Jojo all the reality he was unaware about the Jews. Technically, the film intelligently relies on strongly colored, vibrant cinematography and visuals, contrasting greatly with the normally dark vision we have of Nazi Germany. In fact, this not only accentuates the boy's idyllic vision of this world, but also goes against the way the Germans themselves saw their country in those times, which were undoubtedly gray. The sets and costumes agree with this dominant tone, and the reconstruction of the period was satisfactory, although without excessive concern on the part of the producers. The film has a good cast where the most notable name is Scarlett Johansson. The actress is deeply competent in her role, she exudes elegance and shows us all the contradiction of a mother who, trying to protect her son, also tried to act, to have an active position in the political situation, even if secretly, in hiding. She knows that only much later will her own son be able to understand the scope and value of her actions. Roman Grifin Davies is very good in the role of young Jojo, but Taika Waititi, an illustrious unknown to me, is even better in his satirical interpretation of a historical personality that the actor himself admits to deeply despising. Much of this film's strength comes from Waititi's irreverent and inspired action. In turn, young Thomasin McKenzie does a competent and interesting job in the role of the Jewish girl."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}]",100,Yes!

''Hold this shell to your ear and listen carefully. You will hear the song of the sea.'' In his earlier movie the director told a simple and short story extraordinarily, and still I hum that beautiful 'Aisling song' sometime. This movie had a wonderful adventure story of a boy called Ben and his little sister Saoirse. In the journey of running away from an owl witch, the magical creatures and an ancient seashell guide them a path. On the right time the title song makes the way to delight next 10 minutes of the crucial segment in the narration. I love the original version, in Irish even though I don't understand. It was good and catchy, even for the grown ups as well. Feels like, want to visit those places from the movie, but sadly our only option is Disneyland, huh. Disney and Studio Ghibli are the king and queen of fairy tale movies. No one would, but if you are mildly fed up of those, here the new dimensional fresh tales from the Ireland's folklore. Though, it sets in the modern world, but does not abandon to bring the key factors. Like the ancient meet the modern world with the same intensity. Kind of new to hear the words like Selkie, Macha etc., but, brand new for the people who live thousands of kilometers away in the different continents. Animation movie fanatics would love it, but if there are any children like niece and nephew in your home or visits you, watch it with them on that occasion and you would feel differently. 9/10"", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 58), ('Comedy', 42), ('Romance', 22), ('Family', 18), ('Other', 104)]}, {'writer': 'Kamurai', 'score': '80%', 'review': 'Great watch, would watch again, and do recommend. The animation in this beautiful, and some of it reminds me (vaguely) of ""Spirited Away"", but makes more sense.  I\'m sure the relation is the sense that ""Spirited Away"" is Miyazaki\'s display of the Japanese fey, though it is apparently in several other movies (e.g. ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""Ponyo""). This is a movie of great tragedy and powerful feelings, but ultimately is about appreciating your family and people while they are there.  There is charm and uplifting feelings to the entire situation: you\'re not just going to be depressed or moved. As the introduction of the fey start, it is very unclear what is real and what is magic, or if the magic is real.  That surreal attitude to this child\'s adventure seemed to add to the charm of dealing with the situation. The only problem I have with the movie is this ambiguity, there are so many parallels (that often occur in fey stories) to reality that you can\'t tell if this is a story of how a boy imagined an adventure, or if it\'s a fey story full of hidden magic. The details they go into are amazing if you look.  Even the tears shared between fey and human are different.

This entry is another drastic step up from the previous film and the tone takes a dramatic shift in terms of seriousness. The quality and cinematography are simply brilliant in this film. There are so many amazing shots and sequences that just had me completely enamored. These films are ahead of their time for sure. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has the best plot of the series so far. There is a constant threat looming in the background throughout the entire film that is known from the opening minutes. Sirius Black\'s menacing posters and headlines create a real sense of danger, and he truly seems mad. The dementors also deliver a serious threat on screen. Their introduction is terrifying, and their presence is felt in every scene. One of my favorite things about this film is the conclusion, the time traveling elements are perfect and answer so many questions that I had when running through the finale the first time. My fiancé and I were very confused at how things were happening, and I was having a hard time believing it. But it was brilliant the way it looped around, and the audience was given more background information that made those scenes complete. The trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint elevate their performances once again. Their chemistry is amazing, and I have a feeling this complement will be handed out during every film until the conclusion. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Sirius Black and one of the more compelling ""villains"" of the series so far. Michael Gambon does an excellent job filling in for the late Richard Harris, it was really difficult to even tell that it was a different actor. My only complaint about this film was the beginning of the movie was slightly rushed. I felt like from when Harry left the Dursley\'s to when he arrived at Hogwarts the audience was whipped around from location to location, and it was hard to keep track of why. But the plot settles in and finds it\'s groove after that and delivers a near perfect conclusion.

I'm not a fan of dogs... in fact, I'm one of those people who never had dogs, and that's why I didn't develop a great admiration for these animals, despite recognizing that they are excellent companions and can make a difference for many people, in different situations (for example, as part of police units or as guides for the blind). But the truth is that I feel every day how uncomfortable dogs can be, if they fall into the hands of careless owners, or those who do not teach them properly: they howl when alone, they make a lot of noise when other animals pass by, they run to sniff and lick other people without their owners paying attention if they want to have contact with their animals and, worse, they defecate anywhere without their owners taking care to collect the droppings. Yes, the education of dog owners in Portugal is non-existent in most cases. The fault, of course, lies entirely with the imbecile human owners, but it helped me not to harbor sympathy for these animals. The fair, in these things, always pays for the sinner. However, even the human being with less affinity for dogs will recognize the value and the moving beauty of this film, loosely based on a true story that took place in Japan, before the Second World War, and which has already given rise to at least one Japanese film, in 1987. What this film does is to take this Japanese story and transport it to the United States, telling it as if it had taken place on US soil, but keeping a lot of elements, implicit and discreet, that link us to Japanese culture (the dog breed, the dog's name, even the martial arts). I have nothing against remakes and I have to admit that Hachiko's true story deserved a movie... but the truth is that there are a number of similar reports around the world attesting to the loyalty and unparalleled attachment of various animals to their owners. So, if the idea was just to take Hachiko to the US, maybe it would have been better if the script had created a new and entirely fictional story, albeit inspired by the real Hachiko (and other dogs). Having made all these considerations, I believe that we owe a tribute to Richard Geere for another exceptionally well done and very palatable work, in which the actor manages to monopolize our attention in a friendly character, that touches our emotional side. However, and if we exclude the three dogs that participated in this film and played the role of the protagonist, there is virtually nothing more to say about the cast! The remaining actors only say what they are told to say, without adding anything truly positive, nor receiving interesting and developed material for their respective characters. This includes Joan Allen, who appears to have dropped in this movie by parachute. On a technical level, there are several positive aspects to be highlighted, such as the pleasant cinematography, the good choice of filming locations and the intelligent use of the sets and some visual and sound effects. It's not a flashy movie, but it does everything it can to touch our hearts and can even feel corny and sentimental, especially towards the end. I handled it very well, but of course not all people will like it. The choice of animals for this movie was really good, and they are just cute and adorable in the extreme. And we can't forget about that incredible soundtrack, based on sweet piano melodies. It all helps this movie to be exceptionally sweet and suitable for family evenings. However, I leave a note for parents: if you don't want your children to ask you, in an insistent way, to adopt a puppy, don't let them see this movie."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}]",100,Yes!

We all know the German folk tale \'Rupanzel\', and this is a similar kind with entirely different motive. All the above it is not a fairy tale set in the medieval period, but inspired by many real events of the present era. A couple of years ago I saw a German movie called \'3096 Days\' based on the true story. When I heard of this movie is being made, at first obviously I remembered that title, but after seeing the poster alone convinced me not the same. Automatically the expectations rose, and now it\'s got the 4 Oscars nominees, including the best motion picture. The both halves of the movie were entirely different from each other like the two sets of story, but the core of the theme remains same. The first half was a crucial part that takes place completely in a single room with a minimal cast. It does not go through the intro, just begins to tell the story like it\'s already happening and you might take a few minutes to realise the state of condition. The next half is a reaction to what happened in the previous. And again this is also an important storytelling section because like the title, it was not all about the room, but beyond that 4 walls and its roof and floor like how it affected the mother and son. ""If you don\'t mind, it doesn\'t matter."" The movie does not talk about the crime feature at all. Not even considered to reveal behind the motive. So the other side mystery remains as it is. The whole narration was one sided, everything was seen through the eyes of a five year old boy. He begins with the line \'Once upon a time...\' like a fairy tale, because it is to him and with his cute little performance along with Brie Larson\'s, the movie briefs their struggle for freedom. It was a too casual opening, like nothing bad is really happening, just they\'re weird people or maybe agoraphobia, except they\'re not. You know when we say we love to be kids again to escape this complicated adult life, sometimes we won\'t mean it except it was a normal reaction to the situation we\'re in. But what if a five year old boy wants to be four again when her mother thinks its time to him know what the real world looks like. Yeah, that\'s a too much to take in for a young boy, but that\'s the best chance they had to break free from the psycho who put her mother in that room. ""When I was small, I only knew small things.\nBut now I\'m five, I know everything."" It was a tidy place, but the camera angles were impressive. I know it was shot in a studio with a wide open space behind the camera, but that does not the viewpoint in the actual story. When the first half ends, it is an indication of the good parts are over, at least that\'s what I thought of, but what came after was the unexpected expansion in narration. Usually most of the similar tales end in that part itself like for example \'Prisoners\' and the rest is understandable stuff that won\'t be shown. When a tale had a ending like \'happily ever after\', still some people desire for it to continue a few more minutes to know how happy really they are and that\'s what this film\'s second half.  Remember, most of the similar themes have multiple perspectives, like how victim\'s family is coping with, cops are pursuing the suspect, abductor\'s plans and motive, and captives struggle. Like I said it was all about what a mother and her son goes through those years in captivity and after that. There were some suspicious characters and events like I had a bad feeling over the doctor\'s soft talking, also the mother-son\'s master plan when in captive. Those are tiny diversions to viewers assume differently against where the story is heading. It is all about the mother and son\'s mental trauma, especially for the little boy similar to when Tarzan is in a big town for the first time leaving behind his other life. It was a perfect pace as well, neither hurried nor a slow development. The movie was a big break for many, especially for the Irish director, and Brie Larson and of course for the kid.

It reminds me of the beautiful relationship between father and son in The Road (the book — I don\'t remember if the movie conveys this relationship very well, but I do remember the beauty of it in the book).

Are they better off indoors or seeking freedom? Well, she decides that the latter offers them a better chance of happiness (and quite possibly sanity, too) - but the execution of that plan is not without risk! Lenny Abrahamson directs this with quite a bit of subtlety.

I have never read the novel by William Makepeace Thackeray so have no frame of reference as regards the portrayals we witness unfolding. I have read that many find the film lacking in the humorous wit that is rife in Thackeray's page turner, yet Kubrick's take is full of satire surrounding the social standing that is the core beat of the story - well it certainly had me smiling anyways. The film is pretty downbeat, thus, for a three hour movie it can bog down many a viewers patience.

The film closed the 80th Venice International Film Festival, and was selected as the Spanish entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 96th Academy Awards. The flight was carrying 45 passengers and crew, including 19 members of the Old Christians Club rugby union team, along with their families, supporters and friends. Out of the initial crash, 33 people survived but with natural exposure, starvation, infection and other causes the final number was 16. This because, two survivors, Nando Parrado and Roberto Canessa, climbed the 4,650-metre (15,260 ft) mountain peak on the western rim of the glacier cirque without any mountaineering gear whatsoever and hiked for 10 days into Chile to seek help, traveling 61 km (38 miles) to find a rescue team by helicopters. On 23 December 1972, two months after the crash, all 16 remaining survivors were rescued. The news of their miraculous survival drew worldwide headlines and evolved into a media circus about the fact of cannibalism. The director J. A. Bayona (The Orphanage, The Impossible, A Monster Calls, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom), discovered the book of one of the survivors while researching material for the Impossible and bought the rights for the book when he finished filming that movie, while taking more than 100h of interviews with the survivors, and was shoot in location around the crash site and into the actual crash site coasting mor than 60 million Euros. The cinematography by Pedro Luque (Antbellum, Don't Breathe , Blue Beetle, The Girl into the Spider Web) is pretty gritty and realistic, and prosthetics by  David Martí and Montse Ribé, Academy Award–winning special effects makeup artists of Pan's Labyrinth were used.

Society of the Snow is haunting survival drama which accounts for the 70 days of the survivors in the sea of snow between the borders of Argentina and Chile. With a spine chilling screenplay and tragic events that follow, the film never feels 150mins long. I was just a hopeless spectator of the trauma the survivors went through. As gut wrenching and painful it may seem, the film efficiently exemplifies true grit and determination for survival which kept the Uruguyans going. The cinematography is incredibly good capturing some beautiful frames of the landscape while balancing it with tight close-ups that will evoke a sense of claustrophobia in you too. The editing is crisp and sharp wherein the length of the drama never bothered me. Director J.A. Bayona has excelled in focusing on the event rather than deep diving into character studies. His direction is top notch. Its a crime not to highlight the excellent sound design which shifts gears with tragic turn of events. Ensemble performances are fantastic and make it more realistic. The conversations are emotional and dialogues are equally well written which leaves a lasting impression. Overall, With a runtime of 145mins Society of the Snow shines as one of the most eventful screenplays of the genre that makes you gasp for your breath at various junctures of the narrative. It is intense, harsh and quite overwhelming thus making for an intriguing and incredible watch. Survival dramas at its finest.

It\'s the pristine cinematography that helps this stand out - we really do get a sense of the hostility of this terrain, the cold and the dark; the cloud line making an airborne search for them all but impossible. Should some of them set off to search lower down or is their greater safety in numbers? It\'s history, so we do know what happened back in 1972 - but even that doesn\'t impact too much on the gradually increasing senses of peril, claustrophobia and terror and of the best and worst aspects of human nature when facing a crisis.

To take control of this materialised energy, to draw the reins over this monster with its steel muscles and fiery heart - there is something in the idea which appeals to an almost universal sense, the love of power. In 2015, a long-gestating project was announced as entering pre-production – based on Brock Yates\'s 1991 bookEnzo Ferrari: The Man, the Cars, the Races, the film was tentatively calledEnzo Ferrariand was to be written, produced, and directed by Michael Mann (Heat;The Insider;Ali). A long-time racing fan, Mann had been trying to bring Ferrari\'s story to the screen since the book was published (in 1992 it was reported that Robert De Niro was circling the role and Mann would begin shooting right after he completed work onThe Last of the Mohicans), but in 2015, things seemed to finally be moving ahead. Christian Bale was cast as Ferrari and Noomi Rapace as his mistress, Lina Lardi. And then, nothing. Time passed and no more was heard until 2017, when it was announced that Bale had dropped out and been replaced by Hugh Jackman. And again, nothing. In the meantime, a different film was greenlighted – an adaptation of A.J. Baime\'s 2009 book,Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans. Set to star Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, it was to be written by Jason Keller (Machine Gun Preacher;Mirror Mirror;Escape Plan) and directed by Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy;Oblivion;Only the Brave). That version of the project never got off the ground, but in 2018, it was announced that James Mangold (Cop Land;Girl, Interrupted;Logan) had signed on as director, working from a new version of Keller\'s script, written by Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth (Fair Game;Edge of Tomorrow;Get On Up). Rather confusingly, none other than Christian Bale is in the cast, although not as Ferrari, whilst Mann himself is credited as an executive producer. Is this (at least in part) the remnants of his own film? Is his credit related to nothing more than rights, or was he actively involved in making the movie? Will we still see hisEnzo Ferrariat some point? Le Mans \'66(released in North American with the equally generic title ofFord v Ferrari) is an excellently made but unadventurous movie. Mangold is a fine director, but he\'s no Mann, nowhere near, and the film did, to a certain extent, just leave me pondering what kind of kinetic brilliance Mann would have brought to bear on similar material. In contrast, to Mann\'s body of work,Le Mans \'66could never be accused of breaking any new ground or trying anything especially original – it hits all the beats, it hits them well, but it never strays from the formula. Much as Mann\'sAli(2001) was a boxing movie on the surface only, being far more interested in politics and institutional racism, Mangold\'s film isn\'t really about motor cars – it\'s about friendship, male pride, personal integrity, sticking it to the Man, art v commerce, individuals v corporations; it is, in essence, a thematically broad and aesthetically anonymous pre-auteurtheory audience-pleaser made with the technology and aesthetic sensibilities of modernity. And whilst the individual parts may be unsatisfactorily safe and familiar, the whole is unexpectedly accomplished and immensely enjoyable. The film begins in 1959 as Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) wins that year\'s 24 Hours of Le Mans in an Aston Martin DBR1/300. However, shortly after the victory, he\'s told he has a heart condition and must stop racing. The film then jumps to 1963, as Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a brilliant but volatile and unpredictable driver, is running a sports car repair garage in LA, but the venture is failing (mainly because he continuously berates his customers for one thing or another). The British-born Miles has a reputation as one of the best drivers in the world, and is renowned for his almost supernatural ability to identify problems in test cars after only one or two laps. However, because of his personality, no one will hire him. Meanwhile, Ford Motor Company Vice President and General Manager Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) suggests that Henry Ford II (a superb Tracy Letts, who steals every scene he\'s in) buy the cash-strapped Ferrari N.V., speculating that Ford\'s involvement in international racing may go some way to countering the company\'s reputation for making boring and unattractive family cars (in essence, he hopes the purchase will give the company more street cred). Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone), however, turns down the deal in favour of a counter-offer by Fiat Automobiles, which is more lucrative and allows him to retain ownership of Scuderia Ferrari (Ferrari\'s racing division). He also calls Ford II fat. Enraged, Ford II determines to build a car capable of winning Le Mans, a race which has been dominated by Ferrari for years, winning in 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963. Iacocca reaches out to Shelby, the last non-Ferrari driver to have won the event, and asks him to design a car which can beat any Ferrari. Shelby and his engineering partner Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon) get to work but soon Shelby explains to Iacocca and Ford II that they will need a great driver as well as a well-designed car. And so he reaches out to Miles, who comes on board, but immediately clashes with the Ford executives, particularly Senior Executive Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). Nevertheless, Shelby, Remington, and Miles press on developing the GT40, a car capable of reaching speeds of 135 mph, if only it didn\'t keep breaking down. Le Mans \'66is somewhat similar to Damien Chazelle\'sFirst Man(2018), insofar as it uses the grandiose moments of history to tell an intimate story. Whereas Chazelle used the Apollo Program as the background against which to examine a failing marriage, Mangold uses the determination to win Le Mans \'66 as the background against which to examine issues such as friendship and the clash between gifted individuals for whom success is its own reward and corporations who don\'t see value in anything unless it\'s monetarily successful. Indeed, the argument could be made that the film is actually a commentary on the Hollywood studio system, with Shelby and Miles representing independent filmmakers who love the craft and see the medium as an art-form, whilst the Ford executives represent the studio, always more concerned with the bottom dollar than artistic integrity, always getting in the way of the people who, if left alone to work, could produce something spectacular. The film is also extremely funny in places, especially in a scene where Shelby shows up at Miles\'s house, and the two get into a fight on the street. Miles\'s wife Mollie (an underused Caitriona Balfe) emerges from the house, looks at the two men fighting, goes back inside, and remerges with a garden chair, a drink, and a copy ofBetter Living. She then sits down to watch the action. It\'s a hilarious moment, but it\'s one with great thematic importance – this is very much an androcentric world (Mollie is virtually the only female in the entire film), but for this brief moment, the audience is allowed to pull back and laugh at the utter ridiculousness of competitive maleness – boys will be clichéd boys, always trying to outdo each other, and getting all worked up over something as pointless as a fast car. This thematic focus, however, is not to say the film ignores the intricacies of racing; on the contrary, there\'s a huge amount of techno-babble concerning vectors, aerodynamics, the mathematics of torque, the torsion of metal, and the ins and outs of physics. Additionally, although thematically, the focus isn\'t on the races themselves, there\'s no denying that the aesthetic design of these scenes is exemplary, albeit familiar. Mann would have done wonders here, but Mangold, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael (The Ides of March;This Is 40;Nebraska), and sound designers David Giammarco (The Amazing Spider-Man 2;The Dark Tower;The Predator) and Jay Wilkinson (Furious 6;Man of Steel;Alpha) have crafted some truly intense moments. For the most part, Mangold and Papamichael avoid any objective shots (for example, there are no overheads giving us a good vantage of the entire race), and there are very few shots showing us something that Miles is unable to see. The scenes aren\'t shot in the first-person, but our vision is anchored to his. This, of course, contributes to a subjective focalisation and creates the sense of being in the car with him, which brings a default level of intensity, as well as giving the viewer a perfect vantage point from which to see just how fast these guys are going and how difficult what they do actually is. Is there a Mann influence on the racing scenes? Absolutely; if you\'re familiar with how Mann often shoots cars in motion (the camera affixed to the side of the car, with the screen virtually split in two – the side of the car taking up one half, the approaching road taking up the other), you simply can\'t help but notice the similar positioning of Papamichael\'s camera. Are they the best racing scenes ever put on film? No; you can find those in Lee H. Katzin\'sLe Mans(1971), which intercuts footage shot during the real 1970 event with material staged for the film, lending the whole thing an unprecedented intensity that has yet to be topped. However,Le Mans \'66makes a hell of an effort, and that can only be commended. In terms of problems, there are only two of any significance. The first concerns just how safe and rudimentary the film is. Aesthetically, although the race scenes are kinetic and exciting, there isn\'t anything new or inventive in them; thematically, the film doesn\'t say anything we haven\'t heard before; and structurally, it walks a very well-worn path – chances are that everything that you think might happen inLe Mans \'66does happen. This is your basic underdog story, and it adheres rigidly to that template. The character of Beebe is a good example of just how rigidly. In essence, he\'s a poorly written token villain because you can\'t have an underdog story without a token villain (usually in the form of bureaucratic interference). In this case, when Mangold feels the need to inject some conflict into proceedings, Beebe will pop up to throw a wrench into the works. His motivation? Apart from some brief references to how he doesn\'t think Miles is a ""Ford man"", his antipathy is never explained – the character is a Swiss army knife villain who can be used for multiple purposes, a one-size-fits-all token bad guy without an iota of nuance or interiority. The second problem concerns Shelby himself, who is disappointingly one-dimensional (at best), as we learn absolutely nothing about his personal life – for example, the film makes no reference to the fact that by 1963 he was on wife number three (of seven!). Who is the film\'s Carroll Shelby, and why should non-racing fans care about him? We never get an answer – he\'s Matt Damon wearing a Stetson and speaking with a Texas drawl. And that\'s about all the character development he gets. Although these issues are significant in isolation, the thing aboutLe Mans \'66is that it\'s so well made, it rises above the clichéd and overly-familiar nature of many of the individual scenes, resulting in a whole that is very much more than the sum of its parts. A film about friendship and integrity rather than racing, it doesn\'t take any risks, nor does it bend any rules. Indeed it does nothing that could be labelled innovative. For all that, however, I couldn\'t help but enjoy it. It won\'t surprise you, it probably won\'t move you, it certainly won\'t change your life, but the storytelling is clear and refined, and the journey is one well worth taking.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 53), ('Documentary', 34), ('Crime', 34), ('Mystery', 16), ('Other', 73)]}, {'writer': 'Gimly', 'score': '60%', 'review': ""I thinkFord v Ferrarisuffers from mismarketing.

It’s a very good movie that tells the tale of the development of Ford’s race program to topple Ferrari as the champions of Le Mans. Here’s the official description: American car designer Carroll Shelby and the British-born driver Ken Miles work together to battle corporate interference, the laws of physics, and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford Motor Company and take on the dominating race cars of Enzo Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France in 1966. I’ll say up front that even though Ferrari is mentioned in the title, they don’t really play a huge part in the movie. I was expecting things to bounce between each camp as they tried to one up each other in the race for glory. While Ferrari are here and there throughout, the main battle of the movie is Shelby and Miles trying to get their work done amidst the interference from factions within Ford’s management. It still makes for a great story though, and it’s a movie that takes you on a ride of many highs and lows. From technological failures and success, to corporate shenanigans, to father-son moments, this hits so many beats that it kept us entertained the whole way through. Not only does it hit them, it does them very very well. There were some moments where I was genuinely holding my breath. It’s great stuff. Even from a technical point of view there is a lot to love about this. The cinematography was a stand out for me - some of the sunset shots were stunning, as were the very intense race sequences. I’m sure there’s CGI all through this but it was of such a good quality that it was barely noticeable. Damon and Bale are outstanding and lead from the front, with Bale in particular seeming to inhabit the role and transform, as he so often does.

The overall story is fantastic, and while it has some very similar beats to Your Name, it does enough to differentiate itself. All the characters are unique, and their outcast natures makes them have a super close bound that makes each emotional moment that much harder.

That\'s the general opinion of this movie, and I agree that it is a great movie, but I have seen better movies. The story of Citizen Kane is simple, a newspaper tycoon named Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) dies, and his last word is ""Rosebud"". No one knows what it means, and a reporter starts interviewing people Kane knew, to see if they know the meaning of ""Rosebud"". Through flash-backs we get to see Kane\'s life. Now, as I said, I don\'t agree that it\'s the greatest movie of all time, however it\'s great. I love this movie. It\'s a daring and controversial movie of its time, and it introduced alot of new technices in filmmaking. The acting is superb! Orson Welles as Kane is breathtaking, Joseph Cotten as Jed Leland is great. There\'s one performance I can hardly stand though and that\'s Dorothy Comingore\'s performance as Susan Alexander. Hideous performance to say the least! The writing is amazing, and Welles\' directing is out-of-this-world! In conclusion, great movie (however not the greatest ever made). It\'s definitly a movie you need to watch!

Despite all of his TV appearances over the years, and films he acted in to fund his own productions, the first time I was aware of Orson Welles was one of those startling and bizarrely professional yet unmistakably charismatic 'Paul Masson' wine commercials that they tend to make fun of on The Simpsons in these decades gone by. My first thought was 'that voice is amazing', then 'he looks like he'd be a fine grandfather or Santa Claus', and I instantly wanted to know who he was: Just the way he carried himself, I knew he must be both brilliant and someone who was really important. As you can tell, I'm not going to unnecessarily repeat all the endless accolades this film has gotten over the years. If you're any type of film lover, you have either seen this or will eventually--unless you're hit by a bus tomorrow (Heaven forbid) or something else drastic. It's a hallmark of what is possible in cinema. I waited until I was 46 to see this, because of its stellar reputation. It's not my favourite Welles--either acting or directing, and not by a long shot in either regard--but I'm very glad that I finally saw it, and I'll probably revisit it every couple of years for the rest of my life. There's just something really special about it that's hardly ever seen any more--and I think of that just as wistfully as Charles Foster Kane did about his beloved 'Rosebud'. That a 25-year-old could be so gleefully and breathtakingly experimental and innovative, yet still endlessly entertain, is nothing short of miraculous."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 41), ('Comedy', 32), ('Thriller', 24), ('Horror', 22), ('Other', 109)]}, {'writer': 'Manuel São Bento', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com The ""greatest film of all-time"", everyone declares. I\'ve been revisiting David Fincher\'s career this last week since he\'s in charge of directing the upcoming Mank, which premise approaches the story behind Citizen Kane\'s screenplay credit controversy back in 1941. Herman J. Mankiewicz unquestionably helped Orson Welles writing the script for this movie, but if that contribution was enough to warrant his name on the film\'s credits, well... Apparently, it was settled that Mankiewicz (known as Mank) did indeed deserve that recognition since I just had to write his name on the ""written by"" section above. Nevertheless, this review doesn\'t concern that external issue, but yes, the most globally acclaimed movie in cinema\'s history. I always defend that someone\'s opinion about a film is as valid as everyone else\'s. Unless the arguments used are disrespectful, reductive comments such as the cliche ""it\'s just boring"" or the externally influenced ""I don\'t like that actor in real life, hence the movie is awful"", I\'m always ready to discuss a film with anyone who shows respect for the respective flick. There\'s an interesting question people keep asking me: ""should I watch this old movie that everyone talks about? It\'s just that..."" and usually they linger around here. Probably, afraid of saying something like ""it\'s still in black-and-white"" or ""its visuals are so old-fashioned"". This is a pretty common behavior in the entertainment realm that is film watching. I always reply back with another question: ""if you love movies, why wouldn\'t you want to watch such a highly acclaimed film, no matter how old it is?"" And, again, people hesitate because they\'ve never asked themselves this. They\'re afraid that their ""discrimination"" against old movies might affect their overall opinion about them, and then be in that complicated position that is being in a very small minority. If there\'s something time didn\'t change is that people still don\'t know how to behave when they\'re part of a little group with an unpopular opinion. Some follow the offense route, attacking anyone who disagrees with them. Others create conspiracy theories, saying that most people think otherwise because they followed the herd, not possessing a genuine, personal opinion. If you love the art of filmmaking, if you enjoy going to the film theater, then watching older movies will only improve upon that passion. However, there\'s a certain responsibility that the viewer should always have. As a spectator, we must always be able to place ourselves in the adequate period. We can\'t watch a 1941\'s film with the cultural, technological, social rules, and mentality of 2020. It would be extremely unfair to these movies since our enjoyment will be affected by modern political views, religious perspectives, and historical differences. We will look at a film like Citizen Kane, and deceivingly think: ""I don\'t see anything remotely new or innovative in any shape or form"". This leads me to a suggestion I always give every movie lover like me. It doesn\'t matter too much if you do this before or after the actual viewing of an ""old film"", but do a quick research on its impact on filmmaking and our culture. Understand why or what makes the movie so special. Learn what to look out for when watching the film, and adjust your knowledge of everything to the year of release. Try imagining yourself as a person living in that year, leaving home to go to the closest movie theater, and sitting in your favorite spot to watch a new motion picture. If you\'re able to do all of this, then there\'s absolutely no way of not acknowledging the unprecedented, groundbreaking, historically impactful Citizen Kane. Still to this day, film critics get that childish, ignorant judgment of ""critics don\'t know how to have fun, they only value artsy stuff that no one cares about"". I\'m not going to enter a debate about this, otherwise, I\'d have to write an essay, but I will address that last part. The ""artsy stuff"" is what movies are made of. Without the artists behind each technical component, we wouldn\'t evolve to the point of getting the visually mind-blowing films we receive every month. Well, Citizen Kane impacted every single piece of cinema and shaped the filmmaking industry. People complain about directors not being able to share their original vision in 2020? Try making a movie 80 years ago, where studios were always responsible for the final cut. Orson Welles changed that process, and much, much more. From the original marketing campaign (it was the first time a trailer didn\'t contain a single shot from the actual film) to the inventive storytelling structure, there\'s no denying that the groundbreaking technical aspects transformed filmmaking forever. At the time, ceilings weren\'t shown, hand-held cameras were unheard of, the lighting had strict rules, and unconventional angles weren\'t used. Gregg Toland\'s cinematography changed all of that and tremendously influenced how movies are made today. His experimental methods gave rise to the imaginative use of ""deep focus"", where the camera shows the foreground, background, and everything in between, all in sharp focus. Toland was so crucial for the success of Citizen Kane that Welles decided to share the credits spotlight with him. Vernon L. Walker, as the VFX supervisor, employed techniques so impressive that just a few months ago, we had the famous Corridor Crew VFX team breakdown a particular sequence, and most of them didn\'t know how Walker did it. The latter was a pioneer in shooting massive crowds and wide interior places. Robert Wise\'s editing is the main component in the famous breakfast montage, by creating a sequence in the exact same location while the actors change their clothes and make-up between cuts, giving the feel of time passing by even though the set design is still the same In every other technical component, innovation is the keyword. Bailey Fesler and James G. Stewart employed rarely used radio techniques to simulate crowd noise and singing. Bernard Herrmann composed an unconventional score due to its pauses and short bits of soundtrack, something utterly different from the typical non-stop music of Hollywood films. Finally, Mankiewicz and Welles\' screenplay. Its structure based on flashbacks and a nonlinear timeline was unique at the time. It\'s probably why the movie doesn\'t feel as old as other films when watching it today. Citizen Kane is decades ahead of its time, technically and story-wise. And its ending... still as powerful and jaw-dropping as in the first time I saw it. It became the most influential movie in the history of cinema. It\'s constantly at the top of many ""best films of all-time"" lists, and it\'s still the number one movie for several critics. Orson Welles\' film is probably the movie with the most amount of hype one ever got, to the point of making people afraid of even saying that ""it\'s fine"", let alone dislike it. If you think Citizen Kane is a bit boring or that the actors aren\'t that good or even if you weren\'t surprised by anything... you\'re far from being alone. People talk about this film like it\'s a once-in-a-lifetime experience, a movie that will take people to Mars or to another galaxy. It\'s understandable if many viewers simply don\'t find any of the phenomenal qualities that everyone talks about. The fact that most of the film is astonishingly innovative doesn\'t take away the other fact that it\'s still a movie from 1941. If it was released today (with all the natural modifications), most people would find it a very well-directed film, technically exceptional, and possessing a quite remarkable character-study. It doesn\'t mean it has to resonate with everyone. There\'s no movie in history loved or hated by everyone, and there will never be one. I don\'t ask you to learn to love Citizen Kane. I ask you to comprehend its legacy, background, and undeniable impact on filmmaking and our culture. Almost every film we see on massive IMAXs today, we owe that to Orson Welles and his visionary production. 80 years after its release, Citizen Kane continues to be addressed by many as ""the greatest movie ever made"". It became the most popular film of all-time, one that went through decades of in-depth essays. Everything that needed to be said about it has already been stated, recorded, and written. No movie warrants higher expectations from its viewers, but this massive hype makes it a dangerous film. People fear being judged for not understanding the worldwide acclaim or simply disliking it. Is it a tad boring? Are some actors flat? Is the story not as mesmerizing and memorable as you\'d expect? Don\'t be afraid to say ""yes"" because all of these opinions are entirely reasonable. None of this contradicts the indisputable influence it had on filmmaking and in the history of cinema. Everything about this movie\'s production and origin, the precedent-setting technical aspects, and the innovative storytelling all prove that Orson Welles was a perfectionist filmmaker far ahead of its time. Is it the best film ever? That\'s a never-ending debate I don\'t wish to be a part of. But it\'s undeniably one of the most magnificent masterpieces of cinema, one that every movie lover must watch.

It’s regarded as “the greatest movie ever made” by many respectable people and was, for instance, Roger Ebert’s favorite film. Charles Foster Kane and his magnificent homestead Xanadu were inspired by media barons like William Randolph Hearst and his never-completed Hearst Castle. The concept naturally brings to mind Elvis and Graceland, Michael Jackson and Neverland, and Donald Trump and Trump Tower (or whatever). On a filmmaking level there’s a lot to appreciate, including techniques that were fresh at the time of its release, such as unusual camera angles, lens distortion and the creative use of flashbacks. Up to that point in film history, for instance, ceilings were never shown because that’s where the mics were located, but Welles included myriad scenes from low angles with the ceiling obvious in the background. Then there are the interesting interpretations, including the two main ones, which seemingly contradict: The enigma view suggests that the nature of a person is ultimately a mystery based on numerous subjective truths of different people’s perspectives whereas the rosebud interpretation proposes that a person’s life can ultimately be figured out based on a key clue. In Kane’s case, the clue is linked to lost innocence, the comfort of childhood, a mother’s love and the lack of responsibilities thereof. As far as entertainment goes, the flick starts with vigor and features some highlights (e.g. the lively dancing sequence, Kane’s political ambitions and the hollow halls of Xanadu) and human interest (e.g. Kane’s relationship with the amateur opera singer), but I found it unengaging too often. I simply didn’t find Kane a fascinating enough character and therefore didn’t ‘get’ the obsession with interpreting his life. Still, I wouldn\'t call this ""Citizen Suck."" For greatest movies ever made I’ll go with flicks like “Apocalypse Now,” “Runaway Train,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” “Dead Poets Society,” “The Mothman Prophecies,” “Watchmen,” “The Green Mile,” “Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,” “Dances with Wolves,” “The Horse Whisperer,” “Lucy,” “Troy,” “One-Eyed Jacks,” “Mutiny on the Bounty” (1962), “Tarzan and His Mate” and “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.” The film runs 1 hour, 59 minutes, and was shot in SoCal and New York.

Shortly his combination of wealth, determination and deftness has created a monster with tentacles into almost every aspect of American life; and with that, as they say about absolute power - a good dose of personal ambition and corruption. Gradually losing those around him who debate and challenge, he becomes an intellectual brute; a tyrant - and an emotionally unfulfilled one at that. Joseph Cotton is also superb as his best friend who suffers with his own internal turmoils as he watches the rise and rise of ""Kane""; Everett Sloane as his long-suffering sidekick and Dorothy Comingore as his second wife ""Susan"" plays her role almost exactly as an immature child, in the care of a stern but equally immature guardian. It is as much a social commentary of 1940s aspirational America as it is a powerful depiction of megalomania - and although it has certainly lost some of it\'s bite over the last 80 years it still delivers a powerful analysis of the concentration of wealth, power, and influence that could easily be applied (to social media domination) today.

To anyone who likes to think they\'re being edgy by calling it overrated or whatever, I know you\'re just saying it because you think it makes you cool and counter-cultural or whatever, so I probably can\'t change your mind whatever I say here, but one thing anyone should try is watching all the Academy Award nominees, or at least the Best Picture nominees, from the 14th Academy Awards, in sucession, perhaps one a day. Despite only winning one award, and famously losing out on Best Picture, this film makes all the others look embarrassingly dated. Even the ones that are also very good look like Roundhay Garden Scene compared to this. It truly is a revolution of a film. Welles could have gone exclusively into gore porn after this and he would still be a good candidate for the greatest talent in American cinema. This film has already been rightfully praised so much it\'s hard to find anything new to say about it, so mostly all I can do is heap on more praise to the pile, but this film deserves it. A few things are slightly less talked about from this film that I do wanna bring up though;\n1. This is a lot funnier than people give it credit for. Welles himself called it a comedy, I believe, and honestly I can see that. There\'s some very witty dialogue. My favourite gag might be the ""FRAUD AT POLLS"" headline.\n2. Weird how Welles\' obvious self-deprecating joke about how he inserted the screeching cockatoo to wake up any audience members falling asleep has been taken out of context and treated as serious by so many people. It seems obvious to me that it was as a sort of bookend to his relationship with Susan, referring back to the shadow puppet scene where Kane makes a bird\n3. The speech about the girl in the white dress is actually one of my favourite monologues in any film. The ""frame story"" actually has a lot of great moments that people often forget because they spend all their time praising the scenes with Kane in them (and fair enough, they are incredible).\n4. Susan\'s bad singing is some impressive work. It\'s hard to sing purposefully poorly without falling into cartoonist shrieking, but actress Dorothy Comingore is very good at sound just bad enough to be believable.\n6. I like how, unlike most films about ""corrupt rich people"", this doesn\'t moralise or turn its character into a Bond villain, but condemns what he represents far more strongly than if it did, because systemic critiques always hit harder than ""rich people are mean :("", which is one of the most helpful to the status quo statements you can make, implying as it does that it would be fine if the ruling class could throw us a bone with a few more scraps of meat on it.\n7. The opening and final shots might be the best one-two punch of those two things in... certainly a major release American film, if not any film ever. We begin with death, and end with youth. All sounds pretty simple when you say it out loud like this but as I say it\'s already been analysed in so much depth all I can say is either redundant or just feels like explaining why a funny joke is funny.\n8.

The live-action films of 1996 and 2000 are stored somewhere in my memory, even though I never really sat down and watched the movies all by myself. Cruella might just be another live-action film from the Mickey Mouse studio, but it\'s far from being yet another remake, much on the contrary. Just like the vast majority of the company\'s villains, Cruella de Vil (portrayed by Glenn Close in the previous installments) was even worse than the generic antagonist with cliche motivations that eventually every studio used and reused to exhaustion. Besides Cruella\'s greedy necessities, purely evil personality, and extreme vanity, this wicked character was driven by something completely unthinkable: skinning short-haired puppies to have more success in the fashion industry due to their soft fur. Anyone with a conscience knows that Disney would never bring this character back to the big screen in 2021 without making some changes, especially regarding this motivation in particular. How would a movie with a dog-killing protagonist at its front and center be remotely successful? Obviously, this hardcore motif no longer belongs to Emma Stone\'s Cruella\'s defining character traits, which might be a no-no for those viewers who are more protective of the original material, as if times and culture didn\'t change from decade to decade. Since the start of Disney\'s live-action remakes campaign, audiences have been divided about how to feel and what to expect from these films. Some wish for a copy-paste version of the same story, while others desire a completely different take on the well-known narrative. However, the best experience - and the primary goal of these movies - is a mix of both: a version that keeps the essence and the message of the original while bringing something new and different to the table to justify its existence. Cruella isn\'t a remake but an origin(al) story based on a classic villain... And it\'s undoubtedly one of the best films I\'ve seen this year until this day! I didn\'t expect to write an extensive review, but with so much to address, I know my thoughts will take a while to transcribe to this article. Let me start with some easy elements that everyone can see and enjoy without having to go into ""deep analysis mode"". The costume design is indisputably the technical standout. The colorfully stunning dresses steal the show visually, but it\'s how it differentiates Estella and Cruella that Jenny Beavan shines in her job. Just from what Stone wears, the viewers can easily decipher what character she\'s playing. The differences between the glamorous, rich people that the Baroness surrounds herself with and the dirty, poor friends Estella meets at the beginning of the movie - Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser) - is also accentuated through their wardrobes. The extravagant parties are packed with Oscar-worthy costumes, but also with beautiful makeup & hair (Nadia Stacey) and absolutely ravishing production design (Fiona Crombie). Nicholas Britell\'s score carries little references to the music of the other installments, as does the film itself. Craig Gillespie doesn\'t hide the Easter Eggs spread throughout the runtime, of which some will definitely please the most avid fans. Technically, it\'s as gorgeous as one came to expect from the studio, but not everything is as impressive as the aspects above. In a movie where even the black-and-white hair and clothes of Cruella pop off the screen, the CGI backgrounds and animals are way too noticeable for the studio that just made a hyper-realistic remake of The Lion King. CGI dogs are employed during most of the runtime, which is not only understandable but also commendable. Animal violence in filmmaking is a serious topic that fortunately was solved long ago. However, the VFX don\'t look good enough, causing the dogs - mainly the Dalmatians - to be an unintended distraction. In addition to this, a specific outdoor location that\'s quite important to the story is surrounded by an awfully dark, fake background that just feels way too off. Finally, the ending boasts a ridiculous sequence made with terrible CGI that will definitely leave the more ""logic-driven"" viewers stunned with disappointment. I consider this a nitpick, especially since it\'s not a film without silliness. In fact, Cruella\'s success partially rests on Gillespie\'s tone balance. Jasper and Horace become the comic-relief characters, starring in the absurd action sequences that occur at parties and other places they decide to steal from. Now, some people might expect that since the other movies are defined by their irrational fun. However, Dana Fox and Tony McNamara\'s screenplay carries undeniable similarities to The Devil Wears Prada and the most recent Joker. Estella\'s life story is far from being a happy tale, and Cruella\'s rise even less. Overall, the balance between the silly comedy and the more dramatic, depressing, traumatic storyline is mostly well-handled, but there are a few moments where Gillespie lets it too loose, especially in the over-Disney-ish last fifteen minutes. So, let\'s address the two protagonists: Estella and Cruella. The comparisons with Joaquin Phoenix\'s take on Arthur Fleck / Joker are impossible to unsee. From the upbringing filled with bullying and family tragedy to the final transformation, Emma Stone\'s character follows a similar arc, but with clear differences concerning the solution for her problems. Estella dreams of being a fashion designer and idolizes the self-centered, self-indulgent Baroness, which takes her down a learning path of how to be successful in the business. The Baroness\' despicable treatment of Estella brings the ruthless Cruella gradually back to life, eventually stealing the spotlight from the lovely little Estella who just wanted to do what she loved for a living... without having to carry on extreme measures. An unexpected, clever twist pretty much completes the protagonist\'s transformation, which genuinely caught me by surprise. I admit that I didn\'t have high hopes for this origin story. Nevertheless, the well-written screenplay deeply explores a previously hollow villain, offering her a touching backstory and comprehensible motivations. While it\'s true that she possesses dozens of identical characteristics to the infamous Baroness, Cruella never truly becomes 100% that person. Honestly, I wouldn\'t mind seeing a sequel, but I don\'t think there\'s room for another film that wouldn\'t hurt the one we just got. So, there\'s just one more aspect to delve into: the cast\'s performances. Joel Fry and Paul Walter Hauser are truly hilarious as the famous duo of thieves. Both share a compelling connection to Estella, one that I believe deserved a better conclusion. They become a family, living and stealing throughout their lives, but when Estella starts giving Cruella some screentime, a few issues arise within the trio. These problems are indeed approached and solved, but in a less dramatic manner than I hoped for. Fry is excellent as the more competent, rational Jasper, but Hauser never stops being extremely funny. The before-mentioned balance is rarely affected by the characters\' comedic banter, which is something the actors also deserve credit for. Emma Thompson delivers one of my favorite performances of her recent filmography, interpreting the Baroness von Hellman. How can you make an extremely over-the-top character feel cartoonish yet strangely real? Someone who clearly feels like an exaggeration of a stereotype but still resembles dozens of people from the real world? Thompson takes her role, and the only reason why she doesn\'t steal the spotlight from everyone else is because the other Emma rises to the challenge of portraying such a classic villain. With obvious references to Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada, Thompson is able to be amusing and vile in the same scene, making every second with her on screen feel incredibly captivating. Nevertheless, Emma Stone manages to stay a level above everyone else. I firmly believe that she\'s one of the best actresses of her generation. Carrying one of the most expressive faces in Hollywood, Stone was born to play a protagonist with two personalities. Without looking at the screen, any viewer will be able to know if she\'s talking as Estella or Cruella. Not only she changes the tone of her voice depending on the character, but the mannerisms alter as well. It would be a massive surprise if such an early Disney performance got an Oscar nomination, so her chances are obviously thin. However, if there was an award for Best Monologue, Stone would be a strong contender. I don\'t recall how many minutes it really is, but I can\'t forget that long, uncut take with Stone at the center of the screen with nothing but her acting the hell out of an emotionally impactful monologue. Switching between Estella and Cruella in the span of milliseconds, her micro-expressions elevate a heartfelt, character-defining speech that will undoubtedly mark this year of cinema. Stone gives not one but two impressive, attention-grabbing performances that will satisfy most viewers looking for a Cruella they can understand and even root for. Cruella is not only one of 2021\'s biggest surprises, but it\'s also one of the best movies of the year so far. Despite the occasional lack of balance between the silly comedy and the dramatic narrative, Craig Gillespie offers an incredibly captivating origin(al) story about one of Disney\'s classic villains. Dana Fox and Tony McNamara\'s remarkable screenplay profoundly explores the Estella-Cruella transformation, giving her non-dog-killing, emotionally compelling motivations, a traumatic, depressing past, and an unexpected twist that will probably catch most viewers off-guard. With one of her best performances ever, Emma Stone delivers an award-worthy display, interpreting two personalities in impressive fashion, stealing the spotlight from the other outstanding interpretations. Technically, the distracting CGI in animals and some noticeable green-screen don\'t overcome the predictably Oscar-winning, stunning costume design, as well as the gorgeous makeup & hair, wonderful production design, and sweet score packed with excellent song choices. A character study that makes this one of Disney\'s best live-action films in the last couple of decades.

Not least because it starts off with one of my lazy cinema writing bête noires - the ""King of England"". There is no such title or person! Anyway, pretty swiftly we find ourselves watching an overly contrived cake incident that must have trashed the expensive shag pile at Buckingham Palace. The visiting son of the US President - ""Alex"" (Taylor Zakhar Perez) gets involved in an altercation with Prince “Henry”, the grandson of the King. A week later he is despatched by his mother (Uma Thurman) on a diplomatic rescue mission ahead of her looming re-election battle and negotiations for a trade deal. What now ensues is way better than I was expecting. It\'s a simple enough bromance/rom-com but it uses adult language and some decent writing to illustrate a courtship that benefits from two actors who actually appear to gel on screen. It does no harm that Perez is very easy on the eye and is quite charismatic - though, surely just a bit too old for school - and both men offer an assured and confident performance that avoids the worst of the sentimental pitfalls - even if we do still get a polo match. As it builds I rather surprisingly found myself engaged with the story. Sure, it\'s light and fluffy, but somehow it\'s very normalisation of a gay relationship between two of the world\'s (theoretical) A-listers is actually quite warm and funny. The budget must have gone on private jets, luxury hotel suites and a couple of his and his powder blue hoodies - and that left the poor newsreader to do an entire Presidential election campaign wearing the same top!

However, this heavily diluted, glacially paced piece of insipid celluloid fluff has none of the above, and it truly escapes me how many critics and viewers have found this utterly bland exercise to be heartwarming, charming and involving. In telling the somewhat far-fetched story of an alleged romance between a British prince and the son of an American president who start out as comically exaggerated adversaries but end up supposedly finding true love with one another, writer-director Matthew López subjects his audiences to an unconvincing relationship wholly lacking in chemistry and stemming from an improbable courtship, much of which arises from a string of all-too-convenient, less-than-discreet engagements that are otherwise supposedly impossible to arrange and coordinate. What’s more, the film’s humor is virtually nonexistent and incorporates none of the edginess generally associated with gay comedies. In fact, it’s so dull and so safe that it makes most Hallmark Channel movies seem downright risqué by comparison. To its credit, the picture makes some modestly eloquent statements about LGBTQ+ equality (even if they’re nothing we haven’t already heard many times before), and it features a fine supporting performance by Sarah Shahi as a smart-mouthed, fast-talking presidential aide (arguably the only genuinely funny element in the film), but it misses the mark on so many other fronts that it’s hard to believe this project ever got green-lighted. It’s a shame that the door opened by “Bros” (2022) to make gay romcoms a more viable cinematic genre has been set back by this underwhelming effort. It’s also equally disappointing that an organization like Amazon Studios – one known for generally doing solid work – could let something as sub-par as this out into the movie marketplace.

I have to admit that it\'s a bit difficult for me to agree with the mainstream media\'s warning about this movie, but they really are correct for once - sometimes they throw you curve balls like that. I mean after all, there was a time when I trusted the mainstream media and I lost trust in them not because they were mainstream, but because they just started to get a lot of things wrong. But that also means that if they get things right for once, I can\'t just categorically disagree with them. And it\'s really not like they are just smearing this movie for no good reason. They do (for the most part) have a valid point. This movie does nothing to actually stop this crime or to help the victims or to help people recognize this crime when they see it. On the contrary, because it claims to be based on true events, it causes people to have a completely wrong impression about this and therefore makes it harder for people to detect it when it\'s happening, because this movie is less accurate in its depiction of the real world than a Liam Neeson action thriller. Actually, Liam Neeson\'s recent film ""Memory"" was pretty good and actually much more accurate in it\'s depiction of child trafficking than this movie. Because this movie really does nothing but reinforce outdated and completely wrong stereotypes. This type of thing isn\'t something that mainly happens in South America or in ""other"" countries and children don\'t just get kidnapped out of the blue by complete strangers and against their will. The sad truth is that most cases don\'t involve a stranger at all, but someone the child trusts and the child isn\'t gonna come running to you begging for help, cause the truth is they are victims of years of extremely systematic and sophisticated psychological manipulation. And the perpetrators aren\'t all tough guys either. Actually a lot of them are quite educated, sophisticated and female because they don\'t raise suspicion. And also it\'s not just about forcing the kids to make movies - that only plays a very, very small part, but this movie would have you believe that that\'s the main part - that\'s the smallest part by far! Most of the aspects involved are MUCH worse than ""just"" that. And as much as I would love to think that there are plenty of officers (official or rogue) of government security agencies who are incorruptible and ceaselessly fight the ""bad guys"" in relentless sting operations, the reality sadly isn\'t as clear cut.

It is not very rare to see that an actor's career, however prolific it may be, ends up being especially remembered thanks to his participation in a very small set of films, or even for his participation in a single film. I don't see this as a demerit, but as something unavoidable: only a very limited set of films ends up surviving the test of time and becoming culturally and historically relevant. Gregory Peck was an actor of great importance in his time, one of the faces of honesty and fairness, since he almost always played characters imbued with great honesty and nobility of intentions. As such, he took place in a wide range of films... but let's be honest, it is with this film that the actor reaches the peak of his career, and it is here that he achieves the greatest recognition and relevance as an actor. The film brings to the screen the slightly autobiographical novel by Harper Lee. Strongly inspired by the figure of her father, and by passages from her childhood, the author conceived a story in which an honest and committed lawyer struggles to defend a black prisoner, convinced of his innocence in the face of accusations of rape and aggression against a white minor. Of course, it all takes place in the American South, where racial prejudice runs rampant, as everyone knows. In the midst of all this, a sub-plot also develops, involving a reclusive, mentally weak neighbor, who creates a liking for the lawyer's daughter. I'll start by saying that I've never read the original book, so I'm not sure if the movie does justice to its content. However, when preparing this text, I concluded that the writer watched some footage at the invitation of the production and participated in the works with her collaboration, which leaves me with the conviction that the film sought to respect the literary work. Directed by Robert Mulligan, the film is a very convincing drama, but it takes a while to get into gear and to captivate our attention, which is initially invited to focus on children, on the way they behave and interact with the world around then. It will be, moreover, through the eyes of one of them, that we will observe the events. As I said, it is in this film that Gregory Peck reaches the highest point of his career, giving us an inspired, profound and emotional interpretation of the main character. He was one of the most relevant actors of his time and there are a number of other films where he shines and deserves a closer look from us, but this is where he immortalizes himself. Without coincidence, this is where the actor receives his Oscar for Best Actor, after being nominated four times. Despite being very young, Mary Badham's performance and a silent appearance by a young Robert Duvall are also worth noting. Technically, the film is quite discreet and gives the audience plenty of room to focus on the story told. There are no great visual gimmicks, there are no noteworthy effects, but we have excellent black-and-white cinematography with occasional artistic notes and a good filming work. The editing was also very well done, and gave the film a pleasant pace.

The courtroom drama leads events to turn positively sinister; the scene with the two children returning home through the woods from their fancy dress party has to be amongst the most effectively tense pieces of cinema ever made.

The visual odyssey of Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins is an incredible journey. Yes, the story is very thin but that's something that made 1917 a somewhat different film\nIt's not a war epic, nor does it try to be one. It's kind of a lone wolf war story, though at the beginning it wasn't like that, and that's good because despite everything that happens, the film doesn't lose that sense of camaraderie at the task that remains after the loss. 1917 is a story of survival and that although it could not be considered completely original, that's totally the least of its problems because after all the experience is just spectacular. I admit the film has certain rhythm dropouts that I didn't like, especially the scene where Schofield loses consciousness, but at that point we are given the extraordinary night sequence, so my discomfort ended up disappearing. 1917 is not a perfect film, but it's a reminder of how wonderful is to enjoy a film as they should be, even if it's a film that deals with the horrors of war.

The one-shot approach becomes a distraction, at times, especially when one ponders ""how did they do that?"", but generally not enough to take away the wow factor. The story, and dialogue, not to mention logic are the real problems that take this movie from great, to merely good. The initial concept of sending two men on an imperitive mission to save 1600 men is ludicrous in itself, especially in a war where men were gassed and gunned down by the thousands. Sending only two of them into unknown situations, in no-man\'s-land was illogical. Then there was the fact the hero seems to never get shot by enemy soldiers, despite being in dead-duck situations. When he does get injured, his wounds seem to magically heal and disappear instantly. Director Sam Mendes must have never had the concussive effects of explosions explained to him, because while some fall from explosions, the heroes seem immune to physics. The most ludicrous scene involves booby-trapped explosives, and a collapsed ton of rocks leaving not only no visible injuries, but no effects at all on clothing or hearing. But there was dust in the eyes. There are many more scenes involving lack of logic, or credibility.

And it doesn\'t occur to anybody that the enemy is also firing; that the shells plunge into the hero\'s grave; that his bones are mingled with the filth which they scatter to the four winds – and that, after a few weeks, the morass closes over the last resting-place of the soldier. Bent double, like old beggars under sacks, Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs, And towards our distant rest began to trudge. Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots, But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots Of gas-shells dropping softly behind. No tactical or strategic gain was made on the Somme front that was worth the cost in lives. Even had the British and French achieved their breakthrough on the Somme, the Germans had plenty of room to manoeuvre and, unlike the French at Verdun, no national interest in staying where they were. During the winter of 1916-17, the Germans simply withdrew to the Hindenburg Line, east of the Somme battlefield, and it all had to be done again. In the Somme valley, the back of language broke. It could no longer carry its former meanings. World War I changed the life of words and images in art, radically and forever. It brought our culture into the age of mass-produced, industrialised death. This, at first, was indescribable. My paternal grandfather fought during the Great War. Corporal Edward J. Campbell was with the 9th Battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, 48th Brigade, 16th (Irish) Division and took part in the capture of Ginchy on September 9, 1916 during the Battle of the Somme. My dad was born in 1933, and in all the years that came afterwards – even when he himself joined the RAF – his father never spoke about those years. The Great War broke men in ways the likes of which had never been seen before, and perhaps have never been seen since. It exposed men to psychological horrors inconceivable to most people today. The nature of trench warfare and the concomitant use of artillery on a scale beyond anything in human history did such things to men\'s minds that even thousands of those who returned never really left the battlefields. We\'ve all seen ""Shell shocked soldier, 1916"", one of the most haunting photographs ever taken, and the picture it paints is a disturbingly vivid one. But what makes the Great War, the so-called ""war to end all wars"", so much worse than it had to be was that it pitted old school tactics against modern weaponry. Generals on both sides believed the war could be won, as others had been, by sending wave after wave of men ""over the top"" in an attempt to overwhelm enemy positions. However, such tactics failed to take into account advancements in weaponry, with combatants defending their trenches with miles of machine-gun emplacements and fields of landmines, reinforced with the war\'s most successful killer – endless artillery barrages. The technology had advanced. The tactics had not. Which led to the nine-month stalemate of the Battle of Verdun (February 21 to December 18, 1916), during which the Germans lost 143,000 men and the French lost 163,000. Which led to the first day of the Somme (July 1, 1916), when the British suffered nearly 20,000 loses in less than 12 hours. Which led to the unimaginable slaughter of the hell-come-to-Earth that was the Third Battle of Ypres, better known today as Passchendaele (July 31 to November 10, 1917), where at least 400,000 men died, maybe as many as twice that. Every soul who fought in those battles is gone now. The last surviving combat veteran, Chief Petty Officer Claude Choules, who joined the Royal Navy in 1915, aged just 14, died at the age of 110 in 2011. And unlike conflicts such as World War II or Vietnam, The Great War has largely dropped from the popular consciousness. Not just the reasons why it was fought, but the conditions in which it was fought. Even celebrated films such as Lewis Milestone\'sAll Quiet on the Western Front(1930) or Stanley Kubrick\'sPaths of Glory(1957) aren\'t all that well known. And that\'s one of the reasons that films like 1917 are important – they ensure we don\'t forget. Written by Sam Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns,1917is very loosely based on stories told to Mendes by his grandfather Alfred Hubert Mendes, who was a front line messenger during the war, and who, at 5\'4"", was able to use the low-lying No Man\'s Land mist as cover without having to stoop or crawl, and thus was much faster compared to other messengers. The film is directed by Mendes (American Beauty;Revolutionary Road;Skyfall), and unless you\'ve been living under a rock, you\'ll know that it\'s done in such a way as to give the impression that it all takes place in two single shots (the marketing material says one shot, but it\'s two – there\'s a cut-to-black time-jump about midway through the film where no attempt is made to hide the transition). In reality, of course, there are a lot more than two shots (the longest single shot was just over 8 minutes), but the edits have been digitally \'hidden\', much like Alejandro González Iñárritu\'sBirdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)(2014) or Erik Poppe\'sUtøya 22. Juli(2018). Working with legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins (Kundun;No Country for Old Men;The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford;The Reader;Blade Runner 2049), Mendes wanted the film to be the most immersive war movie ever put on screen, with the story designed to take place in real-time so as to ensure the importance/relevance of the single-shot aesthetic. And although I have some issues with it, and I certainly don\'t think it\'s the greatest war movie ever made, by and large, I think Mendes has made an exceptional film, one in which form and content are unusually tightly matched, with the style extremely effective at delivering the story in a thematically justified manner. April 6, 1917; the Western Front. Two young British Lance Corporals, Will Schofield (George MacKay), a veteran of the Somme, and the younger, more idealistic Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) are summoned to a meeting with General Erinmore (Colin Firth). Recently, German forces have fallen back, and Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) of the 2nd Battalion, Devonshire Regiment believes that if he attacks now, he will break the line and turn the tide of the war. However, he\'s unaware that the retreat is a tactical gambit – the Germans have fallen back to the heavily fortified Hindenburg Line and are lying in wait. With communication lines cut, Schofield and Blake, who has a brother in the 2nd, are given a simple but dangerous mission – to physically carry an order from Erinmore to Mackenzie calling off the following morning\'s attack, a mission which will involve them crossing into No Man\'s Land and traversing the Germans\' former position. If they fail, 1,600 soldiers will be slaughtered. Mackenzie is six miles away. They have ten hours. So, the film\'s big selling point is its aesthetic design. The use of the single-shot format is such a noticeable and idiosyncratic type of form that whenever it\'s used, it automatically places pressure on the content, which must justify why the film is shot this way, why it would lose something inherently thematic if shot conventionally. If the content can\'t do that, in other words, if the content can\'t justify the form, the form becomes gimmicky, drawing attention to itself. Think of, for example, Alfred Hitchcock\'sRope(1948), which was edited to look like one shot, or Sebastian Schipper\'sVictoria(2015), which was legitimately one shot. Very little in either film justifies the stylistic design – shoot them conventionally and they\'re still broadly the same film thematically. Compare this with genuine one-shot films such as Mike Figgis\'sTimecode(2000) or Alexander Sokurov\'sRusskij Kovcheg(2002), and edited one-shot films such as Gustavo Hernández\'sLa casa muda(2010) or the aforementionedUtøya 22. Juli. Whether it\'s the spiralling nature of events inTimecode, the elegant cause-and-effect historical sweep ofRusskij Kovcheg, or the real-time pressure and escalation ofLa casa mudaandUtøya 22. Julithese films tie form to content in such a way that they become indistinguishable – formiscontent, contentisform. And I think Mendes achieves like synergy. Is the one-shot effect distracting? At first, yes, it is a little, especially if you\'re playing the game of trying to spot where editor Lee Smith (Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World;Elysium;Interstellar) has hidden the transitions. But after sussing two edits in the first twenty minutes, I stopped looking, because I realised I was just pulling myself out of the film unnecessarily. In essence, once you go with the aesthetic on its own terms, you forget about trying to spot the edits and asking yourself, ""how did they do that"", instead of letting the cinematography do exactly what it\'s supposed to do – immerse you. This is a film that wants to try to convey what it was like to live and fight in those trenches, with Mendes stating, ""I wanted people to understand how difficult it was for these men. And the nature of that is behind everything"". And, it does about as good a job as any war film I can think of in evoking the psychical reality, if not necessarily the psychological (more on that in a moment). Generally speaking, the majority of the film is shot in one of two ways – either the camera is behind Schofield and Blake, following their path, or it\'s in front of them, facing back towards them as they \'follow\' its path. There are some minor deviations from this (a few drone shots, some side-on footage etc), but irrespective of that, the film never for one second leaves their presence. And because the two men are almost perpetually in motion, it means that the camera is almost perpetually in motion, lending not only a tremendous fluidity to the blocking, framing, and movement, but so too a natural motivation – if they\'re walking along a trench, we\'re walking along a trench; if they\'re moving stealthily through a bombed-out town, we\'re moving stealthily through a bombed-out town. Almost everything the camera does is because one or both of the protagonists are doing the same thing, further emphasising the correlation between form and content. The opening scene serves as a superb introduction not just to the visual design, but to the reasons for employing that visual design and the effectiveness of doing so. The film starts with a shot of a daffodil field, before pulling back and revealing Schofield and Blake taking a break against a tree before being summoned to the meeting with Erinmore. They rouse themselves and begin walking, first past more resting soldiers, then a camp where food and laundry are being prepared, then down a ramp into the trenches, the bucolic opening moments giving way to barbed wire and dirt. Geographically, it\'s a short walk, but thematically, it covers considerable ground. In a film that\'s all about scale and scope, this sequence perfectly encapsulates one of the main thematic reasons behind the single-shot – to accurately convey the importance of geospatial relations. We see the tactile transition from Edenic to hellish because we\'re moving in real-time through themilieuwith the characters; we see the boundary between peace and war because the characters walk along that boundary. You shoot this opening sequence conventionally, and you undercut this sense considerably. Along slightly more conventional lines, one also has to commend the work of production designer Dennis Gassner (Bugsy;Waterworld;Into the Woods). Every location is visually unique – from a German bunker to an abandoned farmhouse to the bombed-out remnants of Écoust-Saint-Mein, and every location feels authentic and lived in. His design of No Man\'s Land is especially laudable, not just in terms of the expected mess of barbed wire and debris, but in the use and positioning of dead bodies, dead animals, and semi-destroyed machinery, with the whole thing having an almost post-nuclear desolation feel. Indeed, the film\'s No Man\'s Land is designed thematically. Mendes has said, ""the first World War starts with literally horses and carriages, and ends with tanks"", and this is mirrored in Gassner\'s designs. When the men first crawl into No Man\'s Land, they immediately encounter a rotting fly-covered horse carcass. Gradually, however, the battlefield becomes more mechanised, until they eventually pass through a German artillery position. Also in a slightly more conventional sense, one has to mention Deakins work during the nighttime scenes in Écoust-Saint-Mein. The entire village has been reduced to nothing but the shells of buildings, and as we pass through the town, the only source of light is from the flares arching through the sky, which create very hard shadows in constant motion. The whole thing is almost otherworldly, and as the garish light traverses the sky, it\'s as if the ground itself is in motion, almost liquid-like, with the protagonists desperately trying to time their movements to ensure they stay hidden in the constantly shifting shadows. It might be a little too aesthetically beautiful for a film aiming for such gritty realism, but for aspiring cinematographers, you won\'t find a better study in how to compose an image using light and shadow. Thematically, by its very nature,1917is far more focused on the micro than the macro – you might learn something about life on the front, but you\'ll learn nothing about the politics behind the conflict, or even a sense of who\'s winning. Partly because of this, the film avoids, for the most part, the overwrought patriotism found in so many American World War II movies, the kind of cartoonish jingoism that made Steven Spielberg\'sSaving Private Ryan(1998) so obnoxious. Indeed, it\'s relatively unimportant which side the protagonists are even on – their mission could have come from any of the combatants. Their nationality is largely anonymous, which is not something you can usually say of a war film, but which does illustrate just how irrelevant lofty political issues were at ground level, with everyone simply trying to survive as best they can. On the other hand, however, because the film is so tightly focused, you shouldn\'t expect too much psychological insight. If you\'re anticipating an existential treatise along the lines of Terrence Malick\'sThe Thin Red Line(1998), you\'ll be severely disappointed. Malick\'s masterpiece is, for my money, the greatest war picture ever made precisely because it subverts at every moment what a war picture is supposed to be. It\'s about the war within rather than the war without, about nature\'s indifference to humanity\'s self-destruction, about the damage war does not to the mind or the body, but the soul.1917is nowhere near this kind of thematic complexity, it\'s not even playing the same game, but I would value its simple individualised insights above something like the empty temporal trickery of Christopher Nolan\'sDunkirk(2017), which leans far too heavily into the ""keep a stiff upper lip chaps"" style of British filmmaking for my liking. In terms of problems. I\'ve seen some critics argue that the one-shot structure is a gimmick which draws attention to itself, and thus, rather than being immersive actually has the opposite effect. I admit that the film does take a little getting used to, but you soon settle into its rhythms (or lack thereof). I would agree that the story is paper-thin, but that\'s pretty much by design. One criticism I did have, however, is how well-groomed Scholfield and Blake constantly are, each with a perfect set of teeth. One only need watch Peter Jackson\'sThey Shall Not Grow Old(2018) to see how unrealistic this is. Indeed, for most of the runtime, the duo look like they\'ve just stepped out of the makeup trailer, and it\'s glaring enough on a couple of occasions to pull you out of things. All things considered though, I thoroughly enjoyed1917. I thought the single-shot strategy worked exceptionally well, and even if the film is weak from a character/storyline/theme perspective, it didn\'t really matter when the form and content are this well matched. This could have become an empty technical exercise predicated on nothing, but Mendes hasn\'t allowed that to happen, and instead, it\'s a war film that does justice to its subject. The more one knows about the Great War, the more one realises that it was hell on Earth.1917doesn\'t make us feel what that hell was like. Because no film, no art form, can do that. But it\'s a damn good approximation.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 53), ('Documentary', 34), ('Crime', 34), ('Mystery', 16), ('Other', 73)]}, {'writer': 'The Peruvian Post', 'score': '80%', 'review': '""Director Sam Mendes employs distinctive but extraordinary shots in the first person during the two-hour footage, which makes the production work in many different ways. Although it sometimes results too shaky, it is thanks to George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman\'s performances that 1917 preserves both sombre but optimistic tones throughout the montage. In short, this is an exceptional approach to memorialise the hundredth anniversary of the end of the First World War"". We are somewhere in France during the Trench Warfare [1915 - 1917] with a depleted British Army; the atmosphere, alongside with the dialogues, can define by itself how was life at the front: scarce water and food, despair between soldiers to go home, endless weapons and corpses scattered on the floor, and so forth. Corporals Blake and Schofield are told to attain a severe/impossible mission despite not having any reinforcements. Before achieving this goal in sending General MacKenzie [Bennedict Cumberbatch] the infamous fallback letter, both privates must penetrate the frightful No Man\'s Land and experience horrendous life-and-death encounters in many places. Regardless of the silent second half, the absence of preeminent performers and the woozy experience of watching the film in one sole perspective director Sam Mendes and executive producers deliver an eloquent portrayal about surprising facts of the four-year global conflict. For example, both soldiers are bewildered by the superiority of the German trenches in proportions and in quality considering that historically they were far better equipped than the Allied ones which allow the audience the opportunity of a lifetime to analyse the condition millions of innocent citizens were facing. The result improves with some accurate shots at landscapes, underground warfare channels, entire villages pulverised, etcetera. I must acknowledge the last fifteen minutes of the film; it has been a long time since I spotted such an imposing ending. Countless emotions appear regardless of having reached the climax. What a masterpiece ladies and gentlemen! What amazes me the most is that despite being a World War film, 1917 does not give the impression in duplicating the ordinary details of previous same-genre releases such as Hacksaw Ridge [2017]. Once Mr Gibson introduced a brief biography of Desmond Doss [the main character] he began recording some ultraviolent scenes as though you were spotting the most savage state of humankind. As an alternative, 1917 delivers some innovative procedures in creating a war film without increasing the brutal strength of instant classics as Saving Private Ryan. Congratulations!

Moments of extreme courage and bravery under fire were balanced by totally justified panic and fear. There were also quieter moments here and there, breaks from the sometimes hard to bear tension.

Wait, one more... Uff, I have no idea how I survived this IMAX screening of 1917. Usually, I don\'t delve deep into technical stuff since most people don\'t know or don\'t care about these attributes, but it\'s impossible not to address Roger Deakins\' cinematography. It\'s not the first time a film has been edited to appear as ""one shot"" (a continuous take), but it never fails to impress me. Alejandro G. Iñárritu\'s Birdman, Silent House starring Elizabeth Olsen, or the famous Rope from the one and only Alfred Hitchcock... all produce the same trick. Even Mr. Robot and The Haunting of Hill House have brought us two phenomenal ""one shot"" episodes, edited as well with the so-called ""stitches,"" meaning that the actual cuts are made to look invisible to the viewer, hence giving that feeling that it\'s all just one continuous take. Cuts are often applied when a random character is passing in front of the camera; when the latter ""pans"" (movement similar to a head-turn) over a wall or an object that occupies the whole screen; or when the characters are simply going through a dark area. Sam Mendes, Roger Deakins, and Lee Smith (editor) all work together to deliver the most immersive war movie (probably) ever. Yes, it has a simple premise, and the main narrative is basic, but the remarkable technical achievement elevates this film so freaking much. Even if you don\'t know the slightest thing about filmmaking or how movies are made, it\'s impossible to watch this film and not think ""something feels different about this one."" This is a movie meant to be watched at the biggest, best screen possible. Watching 1917 at home on a TV or a laptop is not going to work at all. Throughout the whole runtime, I felt like I was there with Schofield and Blake. It feels like we are a third soldier going with them on a vital mission to save thousands of lives. I believe 1917 is the best ""one shot"" film to date (I\'ve been using the quote signs for a reason, don\'t mistake it for an actual one shot movie), with Birdman as a close second. If the latter deals with a lot more dialogue and acting, the former has dozens of nail-biting sequences featuring shootouts, explosions, and a lot of running/walking/swimming through mud, dead corpses, blood, and way too many nasty rats. I really have no words to describe Roger Deakins\' cinematography. It\'s not merely a film, it\'s a whole experience. It\'s not just another cool technical achievement. It\'s the entire foundation of 1917, and the main reason why so many people are rushing to the theater. However, a lot of people are completely ignoring Lee Smith\'s work. Don\'t forget, this isn\'t an actual one shot movie. If it\'s been edited to look like one continuous take, and if it actually does appear to be a single take, then the editor should get as much recognition as everyone else. Yes, he doesn\'t have to work with thousands of cuts (I counted 14, but I\'m sure there\'s more), but they still exist, and he has to make sure no one feels them. And he did so perfectly. My last paragraph concerning the technical aspects has to go to Sam Mendes and Thomas Newman. As the director, Mendes is able to deliver precisely what he envisioned and seamlessly coordinate his actors. Not only has he directed my favorite Bond film (Skyfall), but he also offers one of my favorite war movies of all-time. As for Newman, I just wish that Joker had been released in another year because 1917\'s score is fantastic. Hildur Guðnadóttir is likely taking the Oscar for Best Original Score, but if Thomas Newman takes it, I\'ll still be delighted. A lot of comparisons are being made with Christopher Nolan\'s Dunkirk. They\'re similar films regarding the fact that their main goal is to provide the most immersive war experience. Story and character-wise, both movies don\'t really develop that much. Nolan\'s film is loved by most critics and audiences all around the world, but one common complaint about it is the lack of character building. I didn\'t mind that at all because the movie never actually tried to make their characters important. They were just soldiers caught in the worst of situations, similar to 1917. However, I do think the latter does a better job of making us care for the protagonists. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman\'s characters have small arcs, but they exist. In the beginning, Blake is the emotional-driven character, while Schofield seems to be the rational one. We, as the audience, care about the mission first, but as time goes by, we learn about their personal traits and motivations. By the end of the film, I was crying. Both play off of each other really well, but it\'s their dialogue that impresses me the most. What seems to be just a random talk while strolling through an open field of grass, it truly isn\'t. If it\'s not meaningful at the time, it\'s going to be. The acting is more physical than anything, and both deliver outstanding performances. I would say I love 1917 as much as I love Dunkirk. I might be tempted to choose the former due to the ""recency effect,"" but there\'s one small aspect that negatively affects both. Their replay value is not as high as other films since their technical achievements don\'t work as well on a regular TV in the comfort of our own home. You will never feel or understand that ""immersive experience"" that everyone talks about. You won\'t know what made people to be blown away. You won\'t love it as much as everyone else. So, please, do NOT miss 1917 in theaters! Sam Mendes, Roger Deakins, and Lee Smith. Director, director of photography, editor. Three key filmmaking roles in the creation of one of the best WWI movies of all-time. Edited to look like one continuous shot, 1917 is a mind-blowing technical achievement, elevated by Deakins\' always jaw-dropping cinematography, Thomas Newman emotionally powerful score, Mendes impeccable directing, and Smith\'s seamless editing. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman deliver outstanding (physical) performances, but it\'s the astonishing filmmaking that steals the spotlight. Production design, costume design, sound, you name it. Everything is absolutely perfect. It\'s meant to be seen at the biggest screen near you since this is an incredibly immersive experience that you won\'t get at home.

This war film, which unfolds in two hours of real time, is shot to appear as one continuous take. Thankfully, it is so much more than just a technical gimmick. The showiness eases up as the emotional weight of the story unfolds, but it’s still hard not to get stuck on the challenges and manner of the moviemaking rather than the characters that should be the focal point of the film. Set during the First World War, the story follows Schofield (George MacKay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), two young British soldiers who are given a seemingly impossible mission: deliver a message across hostile territory to the front lines. In a race against time, these men must deliver the information within a couple of hours if they want to stop 1,600 men, and one of the soldiers’ brothers, from walking straight into a deadly trap. The plot is thin, and the characters even more so. Instead of learning more about Schofield and Blake, the showy filmmaking technique commands the spotlight over learning more interesting aspects of these soldiers. It’s more of an experiment in “look what I can do!” rather than compelling storytelling. The camera becomes more of a character than the actual characters. Does this matter? Not really. Roger Deakins is a master cinematographer, and his technique here creates a fully immersive experience. Paired with director Sam Mendes, the two capture the trench warfare of WWI with clever camerawork that not only gives a real sense of the distance these men had to travel, but makes you feel trapped alongside them as fellow soldiers sharing the same journey. The intimate style of camerawork makes you feel as if you are right there in the trenches, on the battlefield, with these two young men. Since the film is made to feel like it was shot in real time, it becomes a psychological wartime thriller as time begins to run out. “1917” is a large scale spectacle that often overshadows its small scale story, but there’s no disputing that it is a grand achievement in filmmaking.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Comedy', 31), ('Drama', 31), ('Thriller', 30), ('Action', 27), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'Liam1125', 'score': '70%', 'review': ""I think this film with very great shot. also the actors was very good.\nBut the story didn't appeal to me. haha"", 'most_watched_genres': [('Comedy', 1), ('History', 1), ('Drama', 1), ('Romance', 1), ('Other', 2)]}, {'writer': 'N/A', 'score': '70%', 'review': ""Excellent original film.

This film was the hit of 2019, and for good reason: it was directed by Sam Mendes, with a script based on his grandfather's war story and a huge production, of the highest quality and full of well-achieved effects. And of course, the film was made in the aftermath of the centenary celebrations of the end of the First World War, which took place in 2018. Understandably, it was a sensation at that year's awards galas, in particular the Oscars, where it was nominated in ten categories, winning three statuettes: Best Sound Mixing, Best Visual Effects and Best Cinematography. I think that even those who know little about history will recognize the First World War as the moment when classical and chivalric warfare disappeared to give way to industrial warfare. It was in this war that we witnessed the development of machine guns (they were not new, but they became standard equipment), the emergence of the first tanks (we can discuss whether they had a significant impact, in addition to technical advances), the first experiments in fighter aviation and recognition, the first attempts at the massive use of chemical weapons (mustard gas, and others of the kind) and more innovations that made wars bloodier and more inhumane than before. It was also decisive in the redrawing of world borders, with the disappearance of centuries-old empires and the rise of new republics, and in particular, the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is a war that the whole world continues to remember and that should not be minimized. The script is based on a suicide mission: to prevent the massacre of an entire unit of the British army that, inadvertently, marches towards a trap, two corporals have to go through “no man's land” and cross enemy lines to warn them and stop them. Additional detail: one of the corporals is the brother of an officer integrated into the military force about to be annihilated. The absolute simplicity of this script makes it so believable that we immediately feel a strong empathy for such committed soldiers. In addition, we have the strong tension, intelligently worked by Mendes, which leaves us constantly waiting to see what will happen. All the directing and editing work is worthy of being studied by film students, and it is truly impossible for us to saw the cuts and editing. Technically, the film makes judicious use of visual effects and CGI, trying to have maximum realism and credibility instead of a lot of flashy things. There is a good dose of fake human bodies and corpses throughout the film, and we get the feeling that a good part of those trenches were also, to a large extent, the graves of the men who were there. It's not a film full of blood and gore, but it's not easy to watch and it's violent in its own way. As for historical realism, I'm satisfied: the film is slightly based on Operation Alberich, which actually took place in 1917, and in which the Germans made a strategic retreat, abandoning trenches they left booby-trapped and looking for positions that were easier to defend. The design of the trenches made for the film, and the environment lived in them, is one of the best historical recreations of this environment ever seen in cinema, with a degree of precision that borders on documentary. The weaponry seemed equally realistic to me, the props and uniforms are very good. Mendes also took a risk by placing second-line actors in the main characters: Dean-Charles Chapman had already shown some talent in “Game of Thrones”, but this was his greatest cinematographic work to date, and the actor honorably fulfilled what he set out to do. asked of him. George McKay had also not had, until now, the opportunity to show talent in the seventh art, and he was able to give us a committed and very deep interpretation of his character. The best-known actors appear in more sporadic roles: Colin Firth played a British officer in just one relevant but short scene; Daniel Mays also only appears a little, but does what he needs to do."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'rsanek', 'score': '60%', 'review': ""Eh, so-so.

I admittedly do have a difficult time separating film and real life, to me films are just fictional things but I get they can/do have real world implications. Strictly as a film, it is entertaining. Clint Eastwood is remarkably good at being a super racist and super grumpy old man, who literally hates every single person he encounters across the opening portion of the film.

Working from a fabulous script by Ernest Lehman, North By Northwest's very reason for being is purely to entertain those wanting to invest a frame of mind with it, with Hitchcock cunningly putting us on side with what is ultimately a shallow character in Grant's Roger O (the O doesn't stand for anything) Thornhill. It's a neat trick from the master of trickery and devilment. Some of the scenes on show are now almost folk lore such is the esteem in which they are held by movie fans and makers alike. A crop dusting aeroplane attack (the prelude to which has those goose pimples popping up in anticipation), a pursuit on Mount Rushmore and the often forgotten drunk car on a cliff sequence, these are all trade mark pieces of work from Hitchcock. North By Northwest is in my humble opinion one of the true greats of cinema history, where as bleak and as unnervingly brilliant as Vertigo was the previous year, this is the polar opposite in structure and fable, but the result is most definitely equally as great.

It’s entertaining to a point, but also seriously overrated due to some glaring problems… Jessie Royce Landis plays the protagonist’s mother when she was only a little over 7 years older than Cooper and it’s too obvious; the story drags too much at this point (when he’s hanging out with his mother); his chance meeting with a key character on the train (Saint) is too coincidental; their make-out sessions are premature, unconvincing and painfully dull; what happens to the plane is stupefying; the crop dusting encounter supposedly takes place in rural Indiana when it’s clear that it’s nowhere within a thousand miles of Indiana (actually it was shot at the southern end of Central Valley, California, outside of Bakersfield); speaking of which, the geography is too noticeably disingenuous: e.g. during the drunk driving episode there are no cliffs like that on Long Island (it was actually shot at Potrero Valley, Thousand Oaks, CA, and obviously so). Still, there’s enough good here to enjoy if you favor Hitchcock & the cast and don’t mind quaint movies. The film runs 2 hours, 15 minutes (unnecessarily overlong).

It has an octuple, episodic, narrative that marries his own development as a man and an artist with the quite literally revolutionary goings on as his country is, frequently quite brutally, coming into some some semblance of cohesive existence. It focuses on the role of the church in this most religious, and superstitious, of nations and offers us a much less aggressive correlation between the communist Soviet threads so often prevalent in sate backed movies made at the time and of those iconic figures so prominent in Russian history. The imagery is creatively bamboozling at times; the story doesn't follow any linear a-b-c narrative and we are presented with an oblique interpretation not just of his life, but of life in an embryonic nation that is emerging from an almost primitive existence - and that is fascinating (if not always easy to follow and/or comprehend).

This is one of those films that was made with the fans of a personality in mind, more than the rest of the public. This, however, is not exactly a problem in my eyes, it is rather a characteristic of this film, common to other biographical films that are centered on very popular figures such as sportsmen, musicians or others. Directed by Bryan Singer, the film covers the journey of the notable rock band “Queen” and its lead singer, Freddie Mercury, who immortalized himself with memorable performances and a sense of stage and spectacle that only big stars possess. Mercury was also notable for being one of the first major superstars to openly embrace his homosexuality and die of AIDS. As a biography, it is a very acceptable film and, as far as I was able to understand, it respects the essential aspects of the lives and artistic path of those concerned. Of course, being a film about a rock band, we cannot ignore the soundtrack, where we have the band's most famous and recognizable songs, and we can see a reenactment of the famous live performance they did at “Live Aid” in 1985, a one of the most acclaimed live musical performances ever in rock history. Obviously, the film was fated to financial success and, without any major surprises, and after weeks of advertising investment, it found great support from the public and became one of the biggest box office successes of that year. Critics also had no major objections and the film arrived at the Oscars as one of the favorites: out of a total of five nominations, it won four statuettes (Best Actor, Best Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing) losing only for Best Film. In fact, in addition to the good songs and good script, the film offers us one of the best performances by Rami Malek, an actor who couldn't be better suited for the role of Freddie Mercury. In addition to all the physical similarities that he took advantage of to embody the character, he managed to interpret him in a dignified and respectful way, without transforming “his” Freddie into a kind of cheap imitation of the real person. However, as I watched the film, I couldn't help but feel that Malek was the only one in the scene who deserved the spotlight, and that the film lacked an equally good supporting cast that would give some charisma to the remaining band members, transformed into in extras in a story where only Mercury was taken into consideration."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '80%', 'review': ""There are plenty of opinions as to how authentic this is, as a retrospective on the life of Freddie Mercury; but there can be no doubting that the pairing of Rami Malek and Queen's music makes this a captivating couple of hours of cinema.

It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic pictures, yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. I was interested in this man before I'd seen the movie, and it only served to increase my interest. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end. Frank Abagnale Jr. is an astounding and interesting character. The real life Abagnale originally said that he did not believe DiCaprio to be 'suave' enough to play the role, but he certainly does pull it off. DiCaprio's acting is superb, and totally believable as a man who could lie to, deceive, and con everyone he met without once losing any of his charisma or charm. Hanks is also excellent, he plays the role of the obsessed FBI agent well, and also with a likable quality. The interaction between these two characters was great, it was interesting to see a budding relationship slowly build between two characters who were actually positioned against one another. I loved the look of the film. It was a refreshing blast to see the 60s portrayed in such a vivid and colorful way. The whole setting and atmosphere of the film gave it a wonderful and almost (I hesitate to use the word) 'magical' sense. This tone appealed to me much more than a darker tone might have. However, the film is rife with moral ambiguity. As much fun as it is to watch DiCaprio jumping from one place (and identity) to the next, forging checks and spending inordinate amounts of money at a whim, the film never really focuses on the morally bankrupt side of the story. The portion of the film devoted to this at the end still seems to skim over the fact that this man has stolen millions of dollars. It ends on a high note for Frank Abagnale Jr., never fully spelling out the wrongs he committed. Still, this would probably bring the whole film down, and sometimes it's fun just to enjoy a bit of escapism without being told off for desiring such things. I mean, it's hard to be totally strict and upright - you have to love it when DiCaprio's character swindles Jennifer Garner's prostitute for $400! Overall, this is a fun film and really enjoyable.

It comes in the tradition of films like “To Catch a Thief” and “The Great Impostor,” albeit with the more modern tone of “The Fugitive” (1993), minus the great action sequences of that film. You can watch the real-life Abagnale in his appearance on Johnny Carson’s Tonight Show in 1978 on Youtube; he shared several of the stories that made it into the movie. Whether or not they’re true is another story (he was a conman, after all), but they make for an entertaining movie set in the ’60s. The script was based on Abagnale’s autobiography, which is more of a biography since he sat down with Stan Redding for a few interviews. Then Redding wrote the actual book, tweaking it for the purposes of entertainment. Abagnale said about 80% of it was accurate. As for the movie, he said some things are off, like the fact that he didn’t keep in touch with his dad after running away, not to mention he had two siblings and his mother never remarried.

He expressions with her smile and her eyes would have made her a fantastic silent film star. Here she portrays ""Lidia"", married to ""Giovanni"" (an equally potent Marcello Mastroianni), with whom she has a pretty open relationship in what is a rapidly deteriorating marriage. It\'s only after they visit a terminally ill friend ""Garani"" (Bernhard Wicki) that she becomes distraught, leaves the hospital and her thoughts start to focus a little. She visits the home of her youth, he goes to a party to celebrate the release of his latest tome then they both end up at a lavish soirée where they are as if independent of each other - both pretty shamelessly flirting with other, younger, people whilst maintaining just about enough of a façade to remember that this is all about business. Michelangelo Antonioni has created the ultimately crafted fly-on-the-wall film, here. The photography is intimate, almost invasive, at times as we watch these two people heading on a crash course to marital oblivion taking a great deal of themselves with them too. Though at times outwardly superficial, the characterisations are actually quite complex and both play with a subtle, nuanced charisma that compliments the more obvious symptoms of their declining interest in each other. What also adds a richness to this is a distinct paucity of dialogue. Giorgio Gaslini has provided us with a score that allows the photography to tell us great swathes of the story using imagery only - the lack of needless conversation between the characters helps it to showcase the ostentatiousness of their ball or the use of the Milanese city-scape in the darkness illuminated only by the occassional street-light - and that frequently creates a compelling atmosphere as sterile and barren as is their failing partnership. By the end, we know that something has to give, but what might that be? For two hours it just flies by.

I wanted to let it sit with me for a bit before watching it again and giving it a proper response. Films like this, which are hyped to an unbelievable degree, end up sending an audience to end up watching it with elevated expectations, only to be ultimately disappointed afterwards. It’s a fact that many films suffer considerably from this aspect of our cinephile culture, I’ve experienced it with many films before. Chungking Expresshas a reputation that I think may be beyond what it intended, with it being an Out-of-Print title at Criterion, the prices for the Blu-ray being obnoxiously high, and the constant barrage of exuberant reactions from many who’ve seen the film. This kind of superficial intrigue alone can set me up with expectations that are likely to not be met. Every film that is being made does not intend to create this façade of a reputation, it’s just a film. Most creators are not there to make this kind of reaction happen out of their films, and yet, we somehow continue to do so… I’m rambling, aren’t I? I think this is just my criticism with film culture regarding the hyping of certain films. And yet, somehow, despite my attempts to condense these (potential) hyperbolic reactions,Chungking Expressmay have exceeded my expectations. Perhaps that makes me a hypocrite regarding this issue, but then again, if I enjoyed the film to the extent at which it met my expectations (or surpassed them in this case), am I to be negatively looked at for criticizing these actions, but essentially having them work on me specifically withChungking Express? If so, then let it be I guess. Regardless, this film was one of the best experiences I have had in a while. It is surprisingly easy for me to connect with this film and its characters. All of them have a certain struggle they must deal with, whether it’d be relationship problems, not being able to move on, or even simply failing to accomplish a certain task. It’s all relatively simple if I think about it, there isn’t much in terms of characterization for many of the subjects in the film, and yet, I don’t believe there needs to be that much. Simply leaving it the way it is works extremely well, and I’m willing to believe that Wong Kar-Wai understood this. There are statements that explain how Wong Kar-Wai essentially wrote scenarios for the film the morning of and shot the scenes later in the day. Easily, this could lead to a jumbled mess of separate ideas thrown together in the editing room at a feature length time. And yet, he stays consistent in the thematic ideas he proposes. Shot chronologically, the ideas set up through the first half of the film, have threads that continue onwards towards the second half. One of my favorite directors, Krzysztof Kieślowski, uses the elements of interconnectedness within his films. Regardless of how different the stories might be, there is something there that connects each story together. InChungking Express, that idea is essentially brought out brazenly, to the extent at which it initially shocked me. That one moment at the half-way mark of the film, comes at you so fast, that afterwards you’re left gasped for what the film turns into. It’s a brazen switch of narrative, and yet, it’s still leaves the film to be connected altogether. The expectations for love are very much tricky in it of themselves, as is shown with each character that one sees in the film. It’s not simple, it isn’t black and white, but rather a spectrum that one must align itself with, and possibly adapt to if necessary. To deal with the aspects of love in a film can either be hokey and misguided, or it can be meticulous and interesting.Chungking Expressfinds a middle ground between these two, not dealing too much towards the intellectual side of these issues, but not straying away too far towards the clichéd. Wong Kar-Wai doesn’t treat these characters as caricatures. Sure, there are some humorous; sometimes childish, moments with Faye, but it doesn’t take away from her character. As with every subject in the film, there is something to latch on to. All around the thematic ideas of love, or the lack thereof, worked together so well, that it leads to these characters feeling authentic. Not simply words on a script. I really don’t know what else to say. I was awestruck the first time, and I feel even more so now. This is a film that really hit it home with me. More so than other films in the past. I’ll say this, by the end of the film, I had similar vibes to when I finishedLost in Translationfor the first time. Soon afterwards, that film was my favorite of all time for years. Film culture is fascinating, it may lead to disappointing outcomes based on hyperbolic expectations, or it may lead to a film experience that you never thought were possible. I’m beginning to lean towards the latter withChungking Express. What a difference a day made, what a difference a film makes. But then again, it all comes down to personal preference, so for all I know you may hate this film. I don’t know. You do you, and I’ll do me.

Wong Kar-Wai have a personal style of using melancholic characters distorted stories, using elaborate soundtracks in the background. This movie show two drama and crime stories about two lovesick policeman and their search over his relationship with a woman, always in a 0,01cm encounter of distance between them. The first story stars Takeshi Kaneshiro as a cop obsessed by his breakup with a woman named May (replaced emotionally with letters and old pineapple cans), and his encounter with a mysterious drug smuggler. The second stars Tony Leung as a police officer roused from his gloom over the loss of his flight attendant girlfriend by the attentions of a quirky snack bar worker called Express - referred in the title (Faye Wong). Both stories circles around Chungking Mansions, a 60\'s complex of buildings supposed to be residential, but that is made up of many independent low-budget hotels, shops and other services, filled with stores and stalls in the building cater to wholesalers shipping goods to Africa and South Asia, and amid the gigantic Central–Mid-Levels escalator with a length of 800m and one of the two highlights locations of the movie. Both sequences have a unique visual approach sometimes intimate, sometimes frenetic with a beautiful use of color among the chaos that reminds me of the works of the photographer Saul Leiter. On the unique soundtrack using ocidental musics we have the use for the first story is Dennis Brown\'s ""Things in Life"" and ""Baroque"", composed by Michael Galasso, can be heard twice during the first part of the movie.

I thought I might just point that out. A big budget, larger scale action blockbuster. This is the one that would change the direction of Tarantino\'s films. And honestly, it might be my favorite besides Pulp Fiction. This movie oozes with style and beautifully choreographed action. This movie has an anime section akin to Japanese anime. That\'s some cool stuff. Even the non-action parts are some really good stuff. Like the guy from the old Street Fighter movies as Hatori Hanzo and making the Bride\'s sword. And the fantastic soundtrack. The great opening scene where the Bride gets shot and then the somber ""Bang Bang"" by Nancy Sinatra plays. But of course, the amazingly choreographed action makes this movie. A lot of it is showcased in the Crazy 88 fight and the few fights before it. It has some brilliant uses of the style. Of course, there\'s black and white which was actually used to avoid an NC-17, but works very effectively. And the beautifully shot battle between the Bride and O-Ren. No music really adds a lot to it. It\'s quiet and oh so effective compared to the loud blood fest of the Crazy 88. But there\'s also the opening hand to hand fight scene with Vernita Green which is also very well edited. Very surprising scene as it is interrupted by Green\'s daughter coming home and then they talk. And it starts back again as quickly as it began and then ends once again with a knife to Vernita\'s chest. What a brilliant tension filled scene. The movie also never takes itself too seriously. That\'s for the sequel. But the fun action and style leads the whole way. Also along with Buck, and other fun scenes. Lest we forget other great scenes like the whistle scene as Elle Driver comes to kill the Bride in her sleep. Or interrogating Sophie. ""These will be things you will miss."" I love it.

Think an amalgamation of chop-socky, sexploitation, samurai, spaghetti Westerns, anime and cop shows of years past, and you get the heart of Kill Bill.

And it\'s bloody, very bloody. Thurman is great as the avenging Mamba/The Bride, while the inclusion of Sonny Chiba & Lucy Liu adds a touch of class as QT revels in his East meets West berserker narrative. It could have been trimmed down, particularly in the middle section where Tarrantino deals in a calm before the storm ideal, but Volume 1 was one of the most exciting movies of 2003, and most notably it shows Tarrantino to be adept at action directing.

The rest of the film is an intense dialogue between the two through the streets of the city, as emotions and feelings develop.

Directed and written with great skill by Richard Linklater, the film can summarize the first meetings of many young couples out there, and I have no doubt that there are many people who will easily identify with the two characters.

P&P have created a masterpiece of rich and colourful cinema. They have turned a relatively simple Hans Christian Anderson story into a maelstrom of love, ambition, power, control - you name it, it features here somewhere. Emotions run high, cruelty runs rife and all under the baton of Brian Easdale who has created his own ""Ballet of the Red Shoes"" score. Both Walbrook and Goring were underestimated actors, in my view. They had an adaptability that demonstrated a surety of foot as their characters illustrate traits that at best celebrate humanity, at worst denigrate it badly. The dancing is frequently mesmerising with the media of theatre and cinema merged seamlessly to give us a really breathtaking experience.

That’s a goal expertly accomplished in the latest from director Walter Salles. This superb fact-based offering tells the heart-wrenching story of former Brazilian politician Rubens Paiva (Selton Mello) who, in 1971, was seized by, and subsequently disappeared at the hands of, the military dictatorship that overran in the country at that time. Paiva, who was working as an engineer when captured, was taken because of his liberal-leaning politics, especially in his clandestine efforts to assist those opposed to the oppressive policies and practices of Brazil’s hard-line right-wing authorities. His seizure subsequently led to the detainment of his wife, Eunice (Fernanda Torres), and daughter, Eliana (Luiza Kosovski), in an effort to find out who their husband and father may have associated with, as well as what activities he may have engaged in. This harassment by officials, though, was not enough to stop the determination of Eunice and her family from trying to find out what happened to their loved one. In telling this story, the filmmaker not only relates a tale of high suspense, but also presents a compelling chronicle of a family committed to remaining hopeful and uncovering the truth, no matter how horrendous it might ultimately prove to be. In carrying out this mission, “I’m Still Here” successfully fires on all of its cinematic cylinders, perpetually engaging viewers in a gripping, emotionally charged odyssey, not unlike the films of famed filmmaker Costa-Gavras, most notably “Missing” (1982). In my view, this is the film most deserving of this year’s Oscars for best picture, lead actress (Torres) and international picture, hands down, not to mention a bushel of overlooked nominations in other categories.

Rubens (Selton Mello) was formerly a Labour Party congressman in Brazil but now that the military have taken over, he is suspected of ties with the outlawed Communists. He is taken away and shortly after his wife Eunice (Fernanda Torres) and their elder daughter is also taken in for interrogation. For the next twenty minutes or so as she spends an intangible time in jail, we are exposed to some of the most effective cinematic menace I've ever felt. There is no graphic violence nor very little angry dialogue. Indeed, there isn't a great deal of actual physical threat at all. Her imprisonment and her deprivation of information is the stick they beat her with and it's profoundly traumatic. When she is released a week later, she returns home to find nobody has or will disclose any information about her missing husband. As time goes by she and their family have to come to terms with both the emotional and the practical implications as they try to look to the future, unsure of what's in their past. It's perhaps easy to forget amidst the militaristic history of 1970s South America that Brazil also had it's junta and it's fair share of bodies disappearing and that threat is never far away as the film proceeds to slowly follow her attempts to get to the truth, closure and to regain a positive sense of her own purpose. Torres is on great form here. She manages to imbue her characterisation with a fear but also with a sense of defiance. It's not reckless - she has a family to consider, but it's a determined effort to get to the facts, however unpleasant and however long it takes. The intensity of the main plot is diverted, occasionally, by the family and it's own aspirations and problems as they too must come to terms without a father whom they genuinely loved and by the denouement I felt quite drained by just the mere observation of their experiences.

But what happens if we encounter someone who witnesses the same incident and comes away from it with a totally different interpretation? Both views can’t be “right,” can they? Or is it possible that none of us can see the totality of a scenario and claim to know everything about it? That’s the core takeaway from director Kore-eda Hirokazu’s latest feature, an ambitious, skillfully crafted tale told from multiple vantage points, all of them “correct” in their own right, despite the myriad differences that distinguish them from one another, a storytelling technique first developed by Japanese master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa in the screen classic “Rashomon” (1950). Kore-eda’s cinematic homage to the famed auteur, told in three separate but interconnected segments, focuses on the exploits of a rebellious pre-teen (Soya Kurokawa) seemingly prone to acting out as a bully. The youth’s unpredictable behavior, however, doesn’t tell the whole story. His actions appear to be cryptically interwoven with those of his overly protective widowed mother (Sakura Ando), his young middle school teacher (Eita Nagayama), his aging, softspoken principal (Yuko Tanaka), and his effervescent best friend (Hinata Hiiragi), many of whom aren’t always what they seem to be. There are forces at work here that are a cause for concern, prompting the often-asked question, “Who is the monster?”, a query that provides the inspiration for this film’s title. It’s intriguing to watch how the picture’s various story threads come together, reminding us of the old adage of not judging a book by its cover, poignantly illustrating that, no matter how much we may think we know about a particular situation, there’s a good chance we’ll never get a complete picture of it. Kore-eda serves up an eye-opening tale, one that gives us pause to think about our impressions and preconceptions in an age when many of us are all too quick to superficially judge what we see – and in a frequently flawed framework at that. The picture could stand to be a little more swiftly paced at times (especially in the final act), but this is arguably the director’s best and most sensitive work to date, one that, we can only hope, will have the kind of profound impact we need in an age where open-mindedness and tolerance are traits we could all stand to develop to a much greater degree – particularly when pieces of the puzzle are missing.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 72), ('Comedy', 31), ('Documentary', 12), ('Romance', 11), ('Other', 69)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'I\'m not usually a fan of children leading films, but hats have to come off here for a really delightful performance from the young Hinata Hiiragi as the shy and shunned ""Hoshikawa"".

He\'s a bright and friendly boy who lives with his widowed mother (Sakura Ando). She starts to notice that his behaviour is a becoming a bit erratic and after some investigation begins to suspect that he is being bullied at school. A visit to the recently bereaved Principal (Yûko Tanaka) reveals that his teacher ""Hori"" (Eita Nagayama) might be the culprit and apologies are made. The next segment takes up the same story, only this time we look from the perspective of the teacher, a caring and enthusiastic professional.

As a film, it's a waste of time. I don't know if Pink Floyd were aware of the impact that “The Wall” would have when they released it. Today, there is some consensus in considering it one of the best rock albums ever and “Another Brick in the Wall” has become an anthem for teenage rebellion, which does not conform to the rules, dictates and conventions. And I feel free to say all this because rock is not, by any stretch of the imagination, one of my personal preference styles of music. I listen, casually, but I wouldn't pay for a ticket. What this film does, essentially, is to take the concept of the album – which was designed and released as if it were a kind of opera-rock – and give it a look to match in an absolutely dreamlike, hallucinated style. There is no plot other than the one that goes on in the head of the protagonist, the rock vocalist Pink, who seems to be experiencing a very deep depression, as his social and emotional isolation increases, caused by an absent father (he died in the war when he was a child), an overprotective mother, a series of abusive teachers and a recent divorce. Watching the film is like watching a musical nightmare. It's not an optimistic film, and it's not easy to watch, especially because the plot isn't very obvious and there are no explanations. There are several impactful scenes, so I don't know if it's the most suitable film for impressionable audiences. There are many fantasies about war, about power and using power to control others. There are also some good animated scenes, although they are just as disturbing as all the others. However, the film is just that... and Pink Floyd's music.

A waitress from the sticks of Missouri (Hilary Swank) shows up and asks that Frankie (Eastwood) train her, which he refuses to do because she’s too old at 32 and he “doesn’t train girls,” probably because he had an unexplained falling out with his daughter years earlier. Eventually he begrudgingly agrees. The bulk of the film is basically a female version of “Rocky” (1976), except that I prefer the potent drama in this one. The three main characters are well fleshed-out with an all-around reverent tone, not to mention an occasional bit of mild amusement. Frankie and Maggie (Swank) slowly develop a father/daughter-type relationship and it’s touching. The third act, however, takes a left turn that is seriously downbeat. It departs from sports movie formula with a message that contradicts everything the first two acts pushed, which is inexplicable. Sure, I ‘get’ the point: A certain person basically sacrifices everything to do what’s (supposedly) best for the situation and honor the will of a dearly loved soul.

This underdog story of a hardworking Mexican immigrant who found success despite all of the boxes society tried to put him in is one that’s inspiring, satisfying, and universal. As a teenager, Montanez (Jesse Garcia) was in and out of trouble. As he puts it, “when society treats you like a criminal, you become one.” He was on the fast track to a permanent life of crime until his wife Judy (Annie Gonzalez) became pregnant with their first son. Searching for a better life for his new family, Richard relied on his street smarts and entrepreneurial attitude to go out and make his own success story. A go-getter from the start, he ended up working at Frito Lay and, after “thinking like a CEO,” came up with the idea to create a flavor that would appeal to the large Hispanic market and save the snack food industry. It’s a terrific story that captures the Mexican-American experience that’s not often seen in mainstream films. Linda Yvette Chávez’s script feels deeply personal, and she takes Richard’s inspiring, complex story and gives us an intimate picture of the man behind the Cheetos. The result is a very human film about discrimination, determination, and the ability to get a leg up on life by pulling yourself out of a bad situation. The story (which is actually controversial because there is a debate as to who really invented the snack flavor) is full of humor and heart. It’s a love story between Richard and Judy, his supporting, loving wife. She isn’t just a background character waiting in the shadows, but is presented as a very strong, tenacious woman who dominates every seen she’s in. As is the case with most biopics, there’s obvious embellishment and exaggeration, and there’s no shortage of emotional fluffery that is designed to tug on your heartstrings. There’s plenty of discussion about having faith and living the American dream, which does feel as corny as it sounds. There’s a lot of talk about representation in front of the camera, but it’s important behind the camera, too. Longoria put her money where her mouth is and hired a diverse crew for her film because who tells these stories also matters. The final product is something that radiates an authentic tone and feeling that is rare, especially for a biopic. Longoria’s directorial style is polished and well-matched to the script, with a clear vision and voice. The cast is just as easy to love. Charismatic and sympathetic, I was rooting for Richard and Judy the minute they were introduced onscreen. Casting is so important in a film like this, and it couldn’t be more perfect. Despite a predictable outcome and a few obvious exaggerations of the truth, “Flamin’ Hot” is an irresistible underdog story about a disruptor who shook up the snack food industry. It’s a funny, sweet, and delightful film that’s as crowd-pleasing as it gets.

Murder's always lurkin' about. Partners accusin' each other of all sorts of crimes … as long as there's no find, the noble brotherhood will last, but when the piles of gold begin to grow, that's when the trouble starts.” The movie then unfolds with all the inevitability of a Greek tragedy (with Howard doing Cassandra one better, because not even he heeds his own prediction).

Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart), and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) – climb up the titular mountains and Dobbs climbs down from sanity, everything goes pretty much according to Howard’s forecast – which is to say, spectacularly wrong, but spectacular nonetheless; Dobbs becomes paranoid and delusional, convinced that the other two are either going to stab him in the back or ambush him down the line – but never just shoot him on the spot, because they are “yellow.” Even at his most heroic, Bogie had an underlying mean streak; Rick Blaine is a cynical, bitter drunk who is, as one can only be in the movies, Saved by the Love of a Good Woman (even if he doesn’t Get the Girl in the End), and Sam Spade is always looking out for No. 1. It’s in films like The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (see also Conflict, In a Lonely Place) that he lets loose that inner darkness which he only taps into elsewhere, and his descent into madness remains the best part of a great movie (and even then Huston finds room for humor, such as when Dobbs asks an interloper “who’s not civilized?!” right before sucker punching him)."", 'most_watched_genres': []}, {'writer': 'Filipe Manuel Neto', 'score': '80%', 'review': ""An excellent film that deserves to be remembered today, more than seventy years later.

The film continues with Americans surviving various hardships and revealing the worst of themselves due to gold fever, a type of greed that affects those who seek to get rich quickly by mining the most coveted metals in the world. There is no doubt that it is a very good film and that it treats the characters in a very careful way, with each one making a very interesting psychological and moral evolution.

Child psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe takes on the case of a deeply troubled boy named Cole Sear. At first Cole is reluctant to be helped, but as Malcolm gets closer to the boy, Malcolm learns the root of Cole's fears, he claims he sees ghosts. The Sixth Sense was a monster hit back in 1999, a deftly crafted ghost story with a kicker that was talked about by all and sundry, the box office bulged and the critics did rave. Nowadays you will find hundreds of people proclaiming that the film is boringly formulaic, that they worked out the film's premise easily in the first quarter of the film, or that the film is a mere cliché, funny how I don't remember it like that back in 1999! The box office bulged because many went to see the film more than once, they went (myself included) back to see just how director M. Night Shyamalan (Academy Award Nominated Best Director) managed to bluff us and pull the rug from under our feet. I remember vividly both times I saw it in the cinema, the crucial turning point of the piece bringing a collective audible gasp from the viewers sunken in their respective seats, that's the sort of impact that carries a film's reputation far and wide, and that's the reason why I will never rate the film lower than 10/10. Repeat viewings of The Sixth Sense obviously dim its star appeal because we know the tricks of the directors trade, but the film still ranks to me as one of the best of its type for so many other reasons rarely mentioned. The writing from Shyamalan (Academy Award Nominated Best Screenplay) is surprisingly complex, the piece masquerading as a horror picture is emotionally charged, linking children with the paranormal through loss and a need for understanding, the need for closure of unresolved differences, but chiefly and crucial to the film's heart is the message of connection before it's too late. The performances are incredible, Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe is perfectly understated, all the pointers for the denouement are there for us to see, but such is the actors performance, and we now know he is cutely having to play his cards close to his chest, are hidden from us until the revisit of the picture reveals it all. Hayley Joel Osment (Academy Award Nominated Best Supporting Actor) is wonderful, for a child performance in a film of this type to not be over sentimental, is quite an achievement. Sympathetic Cole may be, but Osment never lets it become less than the accepted level of child vulnerability. Rounding out the great trio of leads is Toni Collette (Academy Award Nominated Best Supporting Actress) as Cole's mother, Lynn, fabulous in portraying the love and confusion in Cole's troubled world, this story arc between the two is expertly realised. The direction from Shyamalan is very restrained, forgoing out and out shock value for periods of disquiet, he uses sounds to make the audience sense the unease unfolding in this creepy tale, while his camera work, full of draw ins and pull outs-and subtle side shifts, is adroitly in tone with the narrative. The score from James Newton Howard flits beautifully between the uneasy periods and the sustained moments of query, while Tak Fujimoto's cinematography puts a gorgeous funereal texture over this part of Philadelphia. If you haven't seen it then don't believe the naysayers, because The Sixth Sense deserved every penny/cent it made, its a wonderful, creepy, and yes, at times, a beautiful picture.

How do you make a sequel to one of the finest, most loved modern era films ever? This was something that director James Cameron must have pondered on many a dark night once he had agreed to make Aliens. The answer was to rightly not copy the format so brilliantly laid down by Ridley Scott and his team for Alien, but to embrace its mood and enhance it with thrills spills and exhilaration. This was only Cameron's third feature length movie, and here he was working with the crew who had made Scott's movie so special. Also writing as well as directing, this could have gone very wrong indeed, but Cameron rose to the challenge admirably and set up his marker on how his film would succeed. Keep the premise simple and seamlessly connected to Scott's film, and lets have more. Not just one bad ass acid bleeding alien, but an army of them, and their mother too! They mostly come at night - mostly. Where Alien was a splicing of sci-fi wonderment and basic horror terrors, Aliens is a blend of war film staples to compliment both of those earlier picture things. Thus in keeping with Cameron's more is more work in progress skeleton. Another thing that Cameron instinctively called right was to make Aliens about Ripley (Sigorney Weaver simply brilliant), it's her story. Be it a parental thread or a feminist heroine fighting off the phallic hoards, cinema got in Ripley's extension one of its finest and strongest female characters ever (Weaver was nominated for Best Actress but lost out to Marlee Matlin for Children of a Lesser God). Thematically Aliens has been pored over in regards to metaphors about Vietnam, foreign policy and corporate greed at any cost, and rest assured that Aliens isn't merely one big excuse for a shoot them up bonanza. But realistically, and explaining why it was such a huge box office success, it's with the thrills and terror that Aliens most succeeds. The action scenes are slick and at times breath taking, and the tension is often palpable.

People often say ""Aliens"" is more of an action film than ""Alien,"" but it\'s not a mindless action film and, in fact, the action doesn\'t even start until a FULL HOUR into its 2 hour and 18 minutes runtime (the extended cut runs about 16 minutes longer). The best horror/action movies take this route -- taking their time to build character and suspense before unleashing the horrific mayhem. Some complain about the screaming little girl, Newt, but -- hey -- she\'s a little girl and I think the situation calls for this sort of response. Others complain that Bill Paxton is too whiny as one of the Marines, but isn\'t this the way SOME people respond when facing overwhelming defeat -- even hardened militarists -- particularly by hideous extraterrestrial monsters? Another complaint is that the Marines are depicted as dumb, arrogant ""oo-rah"" types, but I used to be a Marine and this was the way the over-the-top ones acted and, furthermore, these are the kinds of Marines that would qualify for such a dangerous mission -- the (over)confident wackjobs who would get the job done and done right. The initial confrontation with the aliens at the hour mark is one of the most horrific sequences in cinematic history; and the Marines are thoroughly humbled. The rest of the film shows the surviving group literally sweating-it-out trying to figure out how to get off the planet alive where annihilating the creatures becomes a secondary objective. Ripley\'s motherly love for Newt is a good addition and it humanizes Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). The sequences with the alien Queen make for a dynamic and extended climax. Also, Lance Henriksen is notable as the ""artificial human"" and Paul Reiser as an effective love-to-hate quasi-villain. On the downside, the film is noticeably setbound, but that\'s par for the course for these types of sci-fi films, e.g. Star Trek. Another negative -- for me at least -- is that the film features no curvy babes, but this was the case with the first film as well, so it\'s to be expected. Besides, I think the female crew is more believable without someone like Juno Temple or Megan Fox aboard, lol. The bottom line is that ""Aliens"" is easily one of the greatest monster films of all time, surpassing even the first film in the series and leagues better than the next two.

There is no doubt that it is one of the best and most remarkable horror films ever made, and one of the “fathers” of contemporary sci-fi cinema. This film was thought to give logical continuity to the story started in that film, and I think it couldn't be better than it is. There are many people who consider the film to be excessively dated, with sets and effects that look old. I strongly disagree.

When Ripley is saved over fifty years have passed since the events of the initial film. She arrives in a world that has continued to spin while she sleeps, and which does not believe her account. Still, they ask him to return to space when a colony, newly created on the planet where the first Alien was found, suddenly stops communicating. It's pretty clear that someone knows more than they're saying, and that there are, again, very strong interests from a financial point of view. But Ripley will figure it all out in due time. The film is extraordinary and is completely at the level of its direct predecessor: the script has an excellent development, knows how to involve and capture the public's attention. Okay, there's a similar story, with the return to that planet and the return of the aliens, but the premise that leads to the return is the best and most convincing, and we don't feel tired or downtime. There's a pleasant tension, which deepens as the threat grows, and even when we don't see the xenomorphs, the fact that we know they're around increases that tension and the feeling of threat. Cameron continues to prove his genius as a director, and manages to extract the best from everyone involved in his project. In particular, the actors. Sigourney Weaver is at the highest level and gives us an anthology work, which will open doors for her as an actress and which will mark her for life. The rest of the cast does not stand out so much, but we can praise the efforts of actors like Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, William Hope, Jenette Goldstein and Al Matthews. Carrie Hen, in part, is the weakest link in this cast, as her character only appears to arouse empathy and for us to connect more intensely with what we are seeing. The truth is that the way her character – a child – survives in that situation is frankly implausible, almost an authentic miracle. Technically, the film is fantastic. It even seems like a new and relatively recent film, if you don't know what you're watching and that it was released in 1986. The cinematography is clean, sharp and there is an excellent filming and editing job. The effects are done the old-fashioned way, without the overwhelming appeal of digital, and they work amazingly well.

The Ian Malcolm character (Jeff Goldblum) is of little use but he’s funny. Grumpy Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) is the perfect counterpart. You can’t help but root for these characters.

I think that since it was paced like this, it allows us to get attached to the characters which makes the action so much more impactful and suspenseful. And even with that first hour that is primarily dialogue, it's still so engaging since the script is tightly written, it has some compelling conversations on the control that humans have, is well shot, and has some humor that feels natural in the dialogue and is in character. The humor is never forced in situations that are tense unless it's expected form that character, like Ian Malcolm. And then that second half... my God, it's so good. This isn't an action movie to me, it's a suspenseful thriller. There's no humans fighting dinosaurs, exploding cars and planes, and the action is used relatively sparingly. The CGI is also used sparingly and only when it is needed. Both the practical effects and CGI look great still.

In addition I was not too thrilled about the story itself where Spider Man right at the beginning is framed as the bad guy. I know, I know, it is rather consistent with the original comics but Hollywood do not hesitate so change things if they feel like it so why not make a good change for once? The good thing about this movie is the special effects. They are quite cool. Especially the parts in this weird space where Doctor Strange and Spider Man dukes it out. Unfortunately that is pretty much it. The rest of the movie is really dragged down by the childish and stupid behavior of Peter Parker. Him being a real idiot and constantly trying to change the spell was just cringe worthy. Then he continues screwing things up because he do not want notorious criminals to go back to their real place because they will actually die there. Typical Hollywood sob story. Despite what that dumb bitch said towards the end, yes Peter Parker you did something wrong, you screwed up big time and the wrong people died because of it. Another thing that was really annoying throughout the movie was listening to that moron Jonah Jameson from The Daily Bugle. He was spewing almost as much fake news as CNN and it just pissed me off every time he was on screen. It is a shame really. One would have thought that, given that they already did the young and immature Spider Man in Spider Man: Far From Home, they could have made him more experienced and mature in this one. You know, character advancement.

The massive combined gravitas generated by Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and Jamie Foxx would be enough to save any other movie; the problem is that this film is not theirs to save, and it’s barely a film at all to begin with – it’s more like the superhero equivalent of that Pink Panther movie they made with spare parts from previous Pink Panther movies. If I want Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, why not just revisit 2002’s Spider-Man? Similarly, if I have a hankering for Alfred Molina as Doc Ock, why not just rewatch 2004’s Spider-Man 2? The latter was, according to Roger Ebert, “the best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with ""Superman""”. How the mighty have fallen. It’s great to see Dafoe and Molina sharing screen time, but once the novelty – or rather the nostalgia – wears off, we are left with only a reminder of how comparatively superior Sam Raimi’s trilogy was, as well as a testament of how downhill things have gone since then. When Molina finally arrives, following an excruciatingly dumb, seemingly endless first half hour, he does so like a godsend; unfortunately, as much as we welcome the company of someone with a gleam of intelligence in his eyes, Doc Ock’s edge has been dulled by poor stylistic choices – first, his mechanical tentacles are 100% computer-generated (as opposed to Spider-Man 2, which used CGI to enhance, but not fully replace, a set of prop tentacles), and second, Molina was digitally de-aged (as was Dafoe), though in this case, unlike for example The Irishman, the unintended uncanny valley effect might have been a blessing in disguise; after all, Doc Ock is supposed to be a comic book villain, so that grotesqueness actually becomes him. All things considered, everything and everyone endemic to the MCU Spider-Man is as flat and artificial as cardboard (our sympathy inevitably lies with the villains because, goblins and octopuses though they may be, they remain at all times more human – and certainly have a cleverer sense of humor – than any of the heroes with the exception of Tobey Maguire, and while Spider-Man may prevail over Norman Osborne, Dafoe totally obliterates Holland in terms of acting); at the same time, all the best parts are almost exclusively lifted from the work – and not even the best work at that – of a much more talented filmmaker.

My last anime movie was \'Giovanni Island\' and I did not end up liking much. I thought that was a decent movie with an intense WWII story told through the Japanese children\'s perspective. Since then almost half a year passed and now I saw this from the director of \'Wolf Children\'. That was his career best movie, so I think the director wanted to follow the same footstep. Thus he ended up making this one which was quite similar theme, except the sketches were not as cute as that. Like one of the discussion topics on this title, it almost connects with the director\'s previous movie. Maybe something like Tarantino, who tried to connect \'The Hateful Eight\' with \'Django Unchained\', later dropped the idea for the characters that failed to merge. But here the reason might be the drawings which were somewhat different styles. And this one seems for teenagers and adults for having a little mature content when the narration reaches the second half. It opened by a brief telling about the monsters and its world. Came back to the human society to focus on a 8-year-old runaway boy named Ren. While tailing a couple of strange creatures, he accidentally enters the monster world through a secret portal. Soon he meets a beast called Kumatetsu who is one of two candidates for \'the great master\' title, decides to take him as his protege. So the quarrelling begins between them for having difference in everything, but as the time passes, they bond well. Then comes a time for Kumatetsu to compete in what he was preparing for, and the boy who finds his own path. But somewhere when they were getting apart, an evil force brings them together to fight against it. ""People who work hard sincerely will master it quickly."" Felt like I was watching a comedy, that was until the first half. All the character intros were kind of normal, nothing grand, but later found a strong connection to each other and each were very unique in nature to remember. This part is where that suits better for children and what comes next was kind of opposite. Feels fun parts are over, introduces a few new characters as the narration takes as big leap as 8 years forward. This middle section was like a re-launch, like a new story to begin. As a child character turns into a teenager, the movie attempted to fit with adultish stuffs. So there was a semi romance, but feels like the quite friendship track. This is where you think the movie lets you down, a time kill section. Due to the theme that designed to take place between the two worlds, this is very important for moving forward to the 3rd act. I think shortening around 5 minutes would have done good for the pace of the movie. The final act is even more unlike to the earlier episodes that adds a wonderful special effects to bring the action sequence. Sadly the stunts were not as dynamic as I hoped, I mean it was too short especially if you love fights. The kid and the beast combo were like from \'Ernest & Celestine\'. Whenever these two are seen together, that bring so much fun. Basically the movie outlines how humans are obsessed for power, who can go any lengths to clinch it and one of the ways is to let the darkness consume him. I already saw it twice. For the second time view it was even better and I liked it very much. Still, it is not the director\'s best work, as well as not a bad movie to just ignore. After Miyazaki announced his retirement, many anime fans, including me were heartbroken. I never found anyone who can replace him, but a very few names came closer that includes this film director. He already gave some hits, but right now all he needs is to carry on his consistency, and definitely his name would appear beside that legend. I need not to tell you that anime movies are becoming rare these days, so when one make its way and people who watched it says it is a good movie, then must grab it. 8½/10', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 58), ('Comedy', 42), ('Romance', 22), ('Family', 18), ('Other', 104)]}]",100,Yes!

His life was basically a three-ring circus, and he was still able to retain his dignity and escape virtually unscathed. Because of the aforementioned trials and tribulations he endured in those eleven months of the film's making (which IMHO would be worthy of a fine film itself, in its documentation and chronicling), though it may not be as side-splitting in its hilarity as 'The Gold Rush' or 'Modern Times', it will probably hold the closest place to my heart of Chaplin's films."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 41), ('Comedy', 32), ('Thriller', 24), ('Horror', 22), ('Other', 109)]}]",100,Yes!

I was really curious to see this movie, because as far as I can remember it was the first Chinese movie I saw. Before I saw it, I read a little about it, and I was quite impressed to see how the film did well in the West, and managed to infuriate Chinese Communist censors. However, I fear that I was not fully prepared for what awaited me. In fact, the film is truly brutal, in every sense of the word. Director Kaige Chen took a well-known and respected book for his film, but put all the focus on an almost visceral realism. The film is an epic that spans a large period of time, between 1924 and 1977, that is, very troubled years in Chinese history, which includes the entire period of war against Japan and the invasion of Manchuria, as well as the cultural revolution. Maoist. At the same time, it reveals the backstage of Cantonese opera, a traditional Chinese cultural style. In the film, two young apprentices live a cruel and unhappy life at the opera school, with daily beatings and various abuses, including sexual abuse. One of them will play the female characters in the stories, like a transvestite, since women are not allowed on stage.

No Country for Old Men is directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, and the Coen\'s adapt the screenplay from Cormac McCarthy\'s novel of the same name. It stars Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Woody Harelson, Javier Bardem and Kelly Macdonald. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Roger Deakins. When a hunter stumbles upon the bloody aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, he decides to make off with cash left at the scene, that violence and life threat will follow from here on in... Not quite the genius masterpiece some would have you believe, this is however and decidedly dark, sombre, gothic type thriller with noir shadings. The ultimate message slowly pulsing away is one of how making a fateful decision can shape the course of many people\'s lives, with fate ready at various junctures to trip you up. The Coen\'s and McCarthy are not in it to offer hope for a better world, this really is a life stinks and is evil narrative, none more so than portrayed by Bardem\'s chilling psycopath. The unpredictable nature of the story keeps things on the high heat, even as Deakins brings beauty via his colour photography, his teaming with the Coen\'s brings visual smarts. The screenplay is tightly formed, giving the actors something great to work with, and as they respond in kind, while we the audience are drawn in close to the slow burning madness. It definitely finds the brothers Coen returning to their best, as they take McCarthy\'s melancholic machismo and drip their self aware irony over proceedings. The finale lacks a punch, and in fact it\'s a little boorish, while this narrative has been done well before in film noirs of the original wave - so it\'s not as fresh and exciting to us more mature film lovers. Yet it\'s still a great piece of film making, the like we could do with more regularly. 9/10 , gorgeously photographed by longtime Coen associate Roger Deakins, and genuinely smart, but its insights boil down to ""Whichever way you turn, fate sticks out a foot to trip you,"" and DETOUR (1945) got there first.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 43), ('Thriller', 42), ('Crime', 34), ('Action', 29), ('Other', 111)]}, {'writer': 'Peter McGinn', 'score': '60%', 'review': 'I watched this for the first time with a few friends as part of an ongoing movie night we shared.

Based on the real accounts of allied soldiers escaping en mass from a German POW camp back in 1942, the film is involving from start to finish, due in the main to the wonderful array of characters on show. We follow them from the moment they arrive at the camp right through to the stunning climax, and it is with great joy I say that none of the cast lets the side down, they all do great work for the astute and undervalued Sturges. A number of great set pieces align with Elmer Bernstein\'s fabulous score to  never let the blood settle, and in among the cheeky slices of humour is palpable tension to make this simply one of the best films of its type, in fact one of the best films ever. Sturges and his writers, James Clavell & W.R. Burnett, adapt from the book written by Paul Brickhill, someone who speaks from experience having been one of the prisoners of super POW camp Stalag Luft III, which of course is what The Great Escape is born from. Sturges was fascinated by the story and after trying without fail for over a decade to get it onto the screen, he finally succeeded. The success three years earlier of his star ensemble Western, The Magnificent Seven, enabled Sturges to realise his vision, the result of which is still enthralling new generations with each passing year.

Steve McQueen (enticing the American audience in one feels), Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, James Donald, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, James Garner, David McCallum, John Leyton and Gordon Jackson. Which of course is a pretty tidy roll call, but the input and impact of Hannes Messemer as the Camp Commandant, Colonel Von Luger should not be understated. His scenes have a real humanistic quality that shows a softer side of Germany to the one ruled by a certain despot (the finale here offering up the counter opposite of the war), the writers smartly, and rightly, not tarring a nation with the same old brush.

Done in roughly a dozen takes, the only times that the camera ever cuts are when it closes in on someone\'s back and then angles around to the other side.  That\'s the tell-tale sign of the only cuts in the entire film. John Dall\'s acting is commendable, in the part of the more ruthless killer, Brandon Shaw.  He\'s a very cool character, and feels no guilt over the brutal murder he\'s just committed.  James Stewart, great as he is, seemed a bit out of his element, as intellectual publisher Rupert Cadell.  Stewart is always immensely enjoyable, and I have massive respect for his talent.  However, he does appear somewhat uncomfortable with his part throughout the film. Another aspect that detracts from the tension is the opening scene of the murder taking place.  After David Kentley is dead, he is placed in the wooden chest and the audience knows he\'s dead from scene 1.  Had Hitchcock omitted the scene of the murder, the audience would no doubt be wondering ""Is there really a body in that chest?  Did they really do it?  What\'s going on here?""

It's also as choppy as a boat ride during a tidal wave, so yes, Braveheart is far from flawless folks. Yet the structure, the epic emotional swirls and sheer spectacle of it all marks it out as a rousing treat. It's a lavish gargantuan epic that somehow seems out of place for the year it was made, perhaps the secret of the films' success is because the 90s were crying out for an epic to get us hankering back to those halcyon days of Spartacus et al. Or just maybe the film punched the buttons of the public psyche because it is a great and grand thing to see the little people rise up and kick some ass? The oppressed and the bullied strike back as it were, surely that theme works for the normal human being? It's a sweeping tale that involves love, loyalty, honour, dishonour, treachery, death & heroes and villains.

Brendan Gleeson, Tommy Flanagan, Catherine McCormack, Angus Macfadyen, and the wonderful James Cosmo all add flavour to the delightful scotch broth on the screen. The score by James Horner is appropriately tight to the themes at work in the piece, and the cinematography by John Toll was rightly awarded at Oscar time since he captured the essence of the film. Be it the lush rolling hills or the blood stained field in the aftermath of battle, Toll's work is critically in sync with the unfolding mood of the picture. So yes, damn straight, flaws and all, pic has the ability to lift and inspire many a discerning viewer. It does kick you at times, but as it does so, it also emotionally engages you from start to finish - to which the film deserves every accolade and award that it won. Because the grandiose epic had seemed long gone, but Gibson and his army brought it back to the modern era and made a genre piece fit to hold it's head up high with the greats of years gone by. 10/10"", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 43), ('Thriller', 42), ('Crime', 34), ('Action', 29), ('Other', 111)]}, {'writer': 'GenerationofSwine', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'When i saw this I was 15 and it was one of the greatest movies I had ever seen.

We have this history drummed into us as bairns, and so when a grand-scale depiction like this comes along, I excitedly expected more. It doesn\'t matter a jot that the eponymous Mel Gibson isn\'t a Scot - that is the acting equivalent of a red herring. What matters is that the story is largely a work of fiction. Gory, beautiful, authentic looking, certainly - but fiction nonetheless. Taken on that basis, then, it is still an entertaining mediaeval drama depicting the struggle of the king-less Scots against the oppression of England\'s King Edward I (Patrick McGoohan). Using a panoply of familiar faces, it gradually demonstrates the brutality of the English over these vassals, and introduces us to ""William Wallace"" (Gibson) who is one of the few who wishes to fight back. The killing of his wife at the hands of his local magistrate (Malcolm Tierney) is the last straw, and soon he is working with his kinsman Argyle (Brian Cox) to formulate a plan. What now ensues is a well produced, stylishly filmed drama offering us plenty of scheming and plotting and some seriously gory battle scenes before it all culminates in the unavoidable denouement. It takes it\'s time to get underway, but once it is up and running it is well paced, there is a minimum of romance, plenty of swordplay and lots of unadulterated freedom-fighter jingoism. Why not? It is a film about a man who fought for the freedom of his people against the tyranny of an interloper, and is effective at that. The historical timelines are a bit all over the place, as are many of the characterisations, but again that\'s another matter of fact that we have had to ditch at the opening titles.

I think this movie was the first Chinese movie I saw, I'm not really sure. I am not an expert on the cinema of this country, but I can say that it is one of those films that you see without much special interest. Of course, I'm talking about the standard audience, because there are really oriental film lovers who will be more interested in this material. The script is based on the story of Song Lian, a very young and well-formed girl who, after her father's death, is coerced into finding a rich man to marry. She ends up being the fourth wife of a man, having to live with the other wives and learn how to behave in a complex family system, where rivalries and envy are part of everyday life. The film shows us a type of family life that, for us in the West, is far from being understandable. It could only take place in strongly patriarchal societies, where the role of women is more than subordinate. It's not a great film, but it's frankly decent, and I don't rule out the likelihood that it's a classic of Chinese cinema (experts will opine better). Gong Li does a very good job in the role of the young Song Lian, and is very well supported by Saifei He, Cuifen Cao, Lin Kong and Qi Zhao. Jingwu Ma doesn't do an inferior job either, in the role of the patriarch and husband of all those wives. The cinematography is very good, as are the costumes and sets, which take us back in time and geography. What prevented the film, perhaps, from being a greater success in the West was the lack of publicity and the difficulty in adapting to the environment of the film, which is very different from the cinema that Hollywood usually exports: it is much more meditative, passive and depressive than most of the cinema we used to see."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}]",100,Yes!

Katsuhiro Otomo has crafted an animated sci-fi actioner for adults that\'s good, great in fact, a rarity since the vast majority of ""adult"" animation fails miserably by relying on dopey sex jokes and idiotic plot rather than solid storytelling and likable characters. Otomo\'s film weaves together themes of friendship, honor, betrayal, the deadly consequences of playing God, gang war, espionage, corruption, and the abuse of power while maintaining a breakneck pace throughout its running time. Throw it all in a blender and you\'ve got one of the greatest, if notthegreatest animated film of all time, a classic in every sense of the word. On July 16, 1988, Tokyo was obliterated in a massive explosion, setting off World War III. In 2019, Tokyo has been rebuilt as Neo-Tokyo, a megalopolis crawling with malignant crime and governed by corrupt politicians where 16-year-old Shotaro Kaneda (Cam Clarke in the 1988 Streamline dub, Johnny Yong Bosch in the 2001 Pioneer dub, Mitsuo Iwata in Japanese) is the tough, cocky, skirt-chasing, and bullheaded leader of the Capsules, a biker gang that\'s currently at war with the Clowns, a band of savage rapists. Kaneda\'s gang consists of his friends, 15-year-old Tetsuo Shima (Jan Rabson, Joshua Seth, Nozomu Sasaki) who\'s like a brother to him, 15-year-old Kai (Bob Bergen, Anthony Pulcini, Takeshi Kusao), and 16-year-old Yama (Tony Pope, Michael Lindsay, Masaaki Okura) and a few others. During a brawl with the Clowns, students are protesting and an odd-looking boy named Takashi (Barbara Goodson, Cody Mackenzie, Tatsuhiko Nakamura) with psychic powers has been abducted. After Tetsuo takes down a Clown, his bike explodes upon nearly ramming Takashi. The boys arrive to find a battered Tetsuo. The army, led by Colonel Shikishima (Pope, Jamieson Price, Taro Ishida), arrives on the scene and takes both Tetsuo and Takashi away, while the boys are arrested. At the police station, Kaneda gets 17-year-old resistance member Kei (Lara Cody, Wendee Lee, Mami Koyama) released with them, having taken an interest in her. Dr. Onishi (Lewis Arquette, Simon Prescott, Mizuho Suzuki) and his team of scientists conduct experiments on Tetsuo, prompting his escape. After Tetsuo steals Kaneda\'s bike to run away with his girlfriend Kaori (Goodson, Michelle Ruff, Yuriko Fuchizaki) and both are attacked by the Clowns, Tetsuo beats a Clown to a pulp before he is again taken by the army to the facility that also holds Kiyoko (Melora Harte, Sandy Fox, Fukue Ito who is credited as Sachie Ito), Takashi, and Masaru (Bergen, Mackenzie, Kazuhiro Kamifuji who is credited as Kazuhiro Kando). When Kaneda tries to find out what happened to Tetsuo, he and Kei soon find that Tetsuo, newly equipped with telekinesis, is being consumed by psychosis, and after he murders one of their friends, an enraged Kaneda resolves to stop him. As you can probably guess from the summary, there\'s a lot going on inAkira, enough that it takes a few times seeing it to get everything, making repeat viewings that much more rewarding. Even with Otomo having removed much of what was in his then-incomplete manga, there\'s still more than enough to warrant its 124-minute length. We see Kaneda worry about Tetsuo as a true friend does, Tetsuo lose his grip on sanity and become someone else, and Colonel Shikishima struggle against dirty politicians who only care about money; it\'s interesting, arguably scary, to consider how much of this stuff is actually happening in the real 2019 andhas been happening for ages. We see the dangers of playing God in the result of Dr. Onishi\'s experimentation as Tetsuo wreaks havoc on Neo-Tokyo which also doubles for the abuse of power and even earlier when Colonel Shikishima says that maybe they should leave that power alone. We also get glimpses at honor when Kaneda tries to curb Tetsuo from killing a Clown he\'s already beaten severely and with Colonel Shikishima\'s musings on a soldier\'s duty. On top of that, Otomo throws in religious fanaticism as people blindly follow Tetsuo, thinking he\'s “Akira.” There\'s more where that came from and the stakes keep rising to keep you on the edge of your seat until the endgame brings things to a close with a bang. Due to Otomo and Izo Hashimoto\'s excellent writing skills, the film isn\'t overstuffed and nothing feels out of place. The animation is stunning. All 327 colors are jaw-dropping; check out those reds. Each background is vastly detailed; the streets of Neo-Tokyo are gritty and grimy, buildings vary from excellent condition to run-down and deteriorated, we see walls and even a door with English profanity painted on them, and the sewers are as filthy as a real one while the interiors of the hospital are exceptionally clean in contrast to the clutter and graffiti of the school the boys attend. Each character looks like a real person, with the wide array of facial expressions that entails, while clothing looks like what real people wear. The gore is also highly realistic. Let it be stated right up front that anyone without an iron stomach will want to steer clear ofAkira. Internal organs spill out, a cop loses half of his face, and limbs are removed, which is not to mention the mutation scene akin to something out of John Carpenter\'sThe Thing. With that said, the gore serves the story rather than the reverse. The attention to detail goes even further to the few animals depicted in the film; the attack dogs near the beginning and even the dog that\'s seen in a commercial on a TV in the background look like real dogs and the rats in the sewer look like real rats. Put it all together and it\'s a depiction of 2019 that looks a lot like the real thing. Another element that never ceases to amaze is the way Otomo keeps everything perpetually moving. Otomo\'s decision to record the dialogue first and animate every nuance of the actor\'s mouth is where he pulls out all the stops since this wasn\'t done in Japan at the time, making it even more impressive that both dubs match the animation as well as they do. Whichever version one prefers, though this fan is partial to the Streamline dub - probably since it\'s how I first saw the film, performances excel across the board. Clarke, Yong Bosch, and Iwata are uniformly excellent as Kaneda, the tough, cocky and womanizing biker who cares about his friends and won\'t let anyone hurt them if he can help it, a lot like I was at that age; moreover, that was around the time my sister became consumed by psychosis in much the same way Tetsuo does. While some have argued against both Clarke and Yong Bosch (usually in favor of the other) as sounding too old, I don\'t think that\'s the case with either; when I was 16, I didn\'t sound all that far removed from Clarke\'s take, having had a naturally deep voice since age 12. Another argument some have made against Clarke is that he speaks in monotone, but nothing could be further from the truth; his tone changes appropriately with the situations the character finds himself in. The same can be said of Rabson, Seth, and Sasaki as Tetsuo, though Seth lags just a little behind. With that said, this can be partly attributed to the Pioneer dub script, though itisgrating that Seth often mispronounces Kaneda\'s name as “Kah-nee-duh” rather than “Kuh-nay-duh” or “Kah-nay-duh.” Take the scene where Tetsuo advances on the soldiers in the government hospital and Seth says, “It\'s no use hiding anymore,” while neither Rabson nor Sasaki says, “anymore.” It\'s not that big a deal and it can be attributed to the Pioneer dub script, but it takes away from his menace some. With that said, all three portray him as an abused kid who loses his sanity and despite being the villain, you feel bad for him - or at least I do since I see a lot of my mentally ill little sister there. Cody, Lee, and Koyama are first-class across the board as Kei, portraying her as tough but sensitive, well in line with how Otomo conceived her. The same can be said of Pope, Price, and Ishida as Colonel Shikishima, playing up his no-nonsense attitude and sense of a soldier\'s duty. Bergen, Pulcini, and Kusao are superb as Kai, one of the film\'s most likable characters. So are Pope, Lindsay, and Okura as Yama, the most confrontational Capsule, and this can also be said for the rest of the three casts. Long story short, you can\'t go wrong with any of them and each dubbed or subbed option is entertaining in its own way and tells the story faithfully enough. Music is a crucial part of any film.Akirais no exception and the Geinoh Yamashirogumi are up to the challenge, using drums, chants, guitars, gamelan percussion, and even a church organ to form Akira\'s musical score.Kanedais the most recognizable, having been used in nearly every trailer. It\'s easy to see why; it\'s an exhilarating track and it\'s hard not to feel pumped once you\'ve heard it. The same can be said ofBattle Against the Clowns,Tetsuo, andExodus from the Underground Fortress. The score mostly remains the same, with the only radically different version being the Japanese hypersonic track that Geinoh Yamashirogumi founder Shoji Yamashiro mixed in 2008 for the film\'s Blu-ray release. In this version, which Yamashiro mastered at 192 kHz, music has been moved around, some pieces are shortened, some are replaced with alternate versions, and the piece used during the flashback to Kaneda and Tetsuo\'s first meeting has been replaced with an organ, heavily altering the scene and not necessarily for the better; if you want my honest opinion, the flashback is more powerful with the original piece of music sampled from Requiem. That said, the entire score is incredible and I\'ve listened to it countless times. In addition to the score itself, Otomo squeezes inTokyo Shoeshine Boyby Teruko Akatsuki during the scene at the mall where the groupies walk off from Kaneda, Kai, and Yama. Throw a head-turning sound design into the mix and you\'ve got a terrific film that\'s firing on all cylinders. Akirais a fun and exciting film I could watch over and over again; as of writing, I\'ve seen it upwards of 30 times since my first viewing. Wanting to see it ever since age 11, it knocked my socks off when I finally saw it at 18. At 30 years old, it continues to stand the test of time. It\'s a timeless film, just as relevant today in 2019, if not more so than when it first dropped on Japan in 1988 and the United States in 1989.Akirawas one of the first anime to arrive in the western world uncut; without it, we may not haveNausicaä of the Valley of the Windand many more of the best Japanese animation has to offer without a single frame removed.Akirais the best animated film ever made for an adult audience and one of the best films of the 1980s, anime or otherwise.

Its imagery will remain burned within your psyche for the rest of your natural life and its musical score will ring inside your eardrums long after the credits roll.

Blade Runner is one of those glorious films that has gained in popularity the older it has gotten.

There was of course some fans who recognised its many many strengths during the initial weeks of its 1982 release, but many who now claim to have loved it back then are surely looking sheepishly in the mirror these days, for the hard-core minority of 82 fans remember it very differently. Remember the spider that lived outside your window? Orange body, green legs. Watched her build a web all summer, then one day there's a big egg in it. The egg hatched... Anyway, that's by the by, the point being that a film can sometimes be ahead of its time, misunderstood or miss-marketed, Scott's masterpiece is one such case. Story, adapted in fashion from Philip K. Dick's story, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Is pretty simple. It's a dystopian Los Angeles, 2019, and there are four genetically engineered Replicants - human in appearance - in the city, which is illegal. They were designed to work on off-world colonies, any Replicant who defies the rules will be retired by special police assassins known as Blade Runners, and Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is on this case. A case that will prove to have many layers... A new life awaits you in the Off-world colonies! A chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure! Ridley Scott gets to have all his cakes to eat here, managing to blend intriguing science fiction with film noir. That the visuals are outstanding is a given, even the film's most hardest critics grudgingly acknowledge this to be an eye popping piece of visual class - the mention of eyes is on purpose since it's forms a key narrative thread. That it is awash with eye orgasms has led to critics calling a charge of beauty over substance, but the deep themes at work here tickle the brain and gnaw away at the senses. Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave. Mood is set at perpetually bleak, a classic film noir trait, and paced accordingly. Scott isn't here to perk anyone up, he's here to ask questions whilst filtering his main characters through a prism of techno decay, of humanity questioned to the max, for a film so stunning in visuals, it's surprisingly nightmarish at its core. The emotional spine is ever present, troubled when violence shows its hand, but it's there posing an intriguing question as the Replicants kill because they want to live. And this as our antagonist, Deckard (Ford a brilliantly miserable Marlowe clone), starts to fall for Rachael (a sensually effective femme fatale portrayal), one of his retirement targets. Tears in the Rain. As Rutger Hauer (never better) saunters more prominently into the story as head Replicant Roy Batty, the pic evolves still more. Haunting lyricism starts pulsing away in conjunction with Vangelis' rib shaking techno score, while Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography brings Scott's masterful visions to life, key characters one and all. Visuals, aural splendour and dark thematics - so just what does it mean to be human? - Indeed, curl as one in a magnificent cinematic achievement.

I would hazard a guess it wasn\'t a big success at the box office back in 82/83 chiefly because of the likes of ET, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, Return of the Jedi and quite a few other adventure/SF films of the time pushing this film into a dark corner. Another reason could be because it was too slow for those brought up on Star Wars; or just too unengaging for those looking at it from a murder-mystery perspective  (I recall reading that the original version had Ford do a Marlowesque voice over). An impressive film for all that, with some delightful special effects, and a decent performance from Ford. But of course for me the true delight was Roy\'s ""Time to Die"" speech at the end.

Ford is on cracking form here, as is Rutger Hauer - the android leader ""Batty"" and the dark, frequently rainy imagery contributes wonderfully to this seedily presented story of greed and manipulation set amongst a grittily dank and hostile environment that offers little, visually anyway, by way of hope or relief.

Honestly, I didn't expect much from this movie. It was a film that was not successful in theaters and that only took off when it went to VHS, acquiring admirers since then and becoming one of the most respected films of all time. Set in a profoundly dystopian Los Angeles, it raises many philosophical and sociological questions around human nature, the course of humanity, our relationship with technology and our morality in general. Watching this film in 2022 was funny because the action of the film, released in 1982, takes place in the year 2019. That is, it was set in a future that, now, is past for me and never materialized (and I'm glad). The film's plot is not easy: humanity colonized other planets while destroying Earth, and created very realistic human androids while destroying itself. However, the androids, called replicants, got out of control, and are now hunted and killed, or used for the most vile purposes. The metaphors are clear, there is a lot of philosophical material, and it leaves us thinking for a long time. Ridley Scott gives us, with this film, one of his masterpieces. The film is magnificent in every way, and it is worth giving it the time it needs to surprise us. It creates a neo-noir plot where nobody is innocent or angelic, and where danger is everywhere. The lighting, the shutters on the windows, the indispensable “femme fatale”, all the classic components of noir are here, in a frankly colorful film with sets and landscapes that combine the most grandiose futurism with the decadence and dirt of the world we destroy. The dialogues are memorable and full of deeply symbolic moments. The characters are rich, dense and complex, and it's extraordinary to think that we still don't really understand, after several decades, whether the main character is human or not. In fact, it seems that time has not passed for this film: if we think that it is from the early 80s, it is incredible that it is so visually powerful and that it has such good cinematography. It looks like a movie made ten years ago. The sets and costumes couldn't be better, and the special effects are stunning. The soundtrack, composed by Vangelis, is smooth and hypnotic. Adding to all this, we have Harrison Ford, in one of the most underrated works of his career. He does a really good job, and he deserved more recognition for that. Sean Young also deserves a round of applause for the way he brought his character to life, a replicant who really thinks she's human.

From the director Hiromasa Yonebayashi of 'The Secret World of Arriety' fame. Based on the 1967 English novel of the same name and so the important characters borrowed the western names. This is what I call a fine adaptation, great transformation from the words to the motion picture. Actually, it suited for the narration from the standpoint of Japanese culture and lifestyle, especially for this anime version with the beautiful fictional coastal landscapes. Whenever I remember this film in the future, that Marsh house would be the first thing to pop out in my mind, an unforgettable landmark for sure. The movie promos were damp. The posters were not that impressive, but okay and the trailer was very ordinary. Studio Ghibli was the reason to go for it, so I expected nothing spectacular from the movie. Even while I was watching, I thought it was just an enjoyable mystery flick, but you know sometime the value of the whole movie comes at the end twist. Once the end was near my stance changed, especially after the hidden truth revelation. Some movies need a re-watch to terminate any doubts regarding characters and scenes. As for this movie, if your focus is straight, then it's does not require. Not a technical brilliance like the director's previous movie, but the story was strong and twisty. The characters were very interesting, suspense was the movie's influence for the audience to stick till the end. There is no loose end, certainly gives a few topics to discuss about, but the narration moves on a circular track and hits back like the boomerang. That does not mean it is a time travel or something. The narration bends and blends with the time. To realise what is real and what is not, you have to wait till the end. After seeing the film, I understood everyone's childhood memories could monopolize if we encounter same object, place, person and other things again in the later life. Yes, I had few minor experience in my life as well. The opening dialogue itself a hint of what kind of movie it is going to be. There are two prominent girls, Anna and Marnie in the story, like the Anna and Elsa from 'Frozen'. The narration flips on a regular basis to tell the multiple layered story. As this film was a puzzle in portrayal, obviously viewers try to solve it, including me. I tried my best. I thought Anna's childhood toy was something to do with all the fuss, but I was terribly wrong. That was a perfect divert if you observe it closely. In another perspective, I kept 'The Others' and 'The Orphanage' in mind, but was not even close to where this story was heading. Whether you succeed or not, very fun to solve a mystery, you know. Finally, it gave me full satisfaction like that indirectly I saw 'The Uninvited' once again. Feels like the Oscars was concluded yesterday, but I am already thinking about the next one. If I am not wrong this movie is definitely one of the contenders for the best animation race, along with 'The Good Dinosaur' probably. Absolutely, I would be disappointed if I don't see it in the final five. There is lots of time between now and then, so anything might happen, who knows. After all, this film has already won my little heart and millions of other's. I know no one can replace Mr. Miyazaki, but feels like Hiromasa Yonebayashi could come near if his future projects as much effective as his one. Best of luck to him and he's only a 41. But remember Isao Takahat is 80 and still in the race, yet to announce his retirement. And this film was very close to his 'Only Yesterday'. I love you more than any girl I've ever known. Studio Ghibli is like Disney Studio from the east. As we know, narrating a fairy tale having the tween girls in the lead is what they're famous for. The previous couple of movies were out of their trademark, so, happy they are back with this masterwork. At a same time I am very very very very sad, because it's their final movie after the 30 years of triumph. Since Hayao Miyazaki's retirement everything falling apart from the studio's management. They've given reasons and it is only a temporary, though hope the rise of 3D animation is not the one to halt the production, praying for the pause to be lifted soon. This film is not just passing through from this giant anime production house, but it is a masterpiece. As usual, it is a girly movie and that does not stop grownups, especially men from a watch. I loved it, everytime when I like a movie I express my desire for a sequel and so I did for this film. Though it was one time story with nothing left over for further development, possibly some new thing can be attached to it. Whatever happens this movie will remain as one of the best from the studio and can compete with any modern animations and live-shot masterworks.

I am not complying about the violence,I  should clarify, just the body count. It is almost like the director came out before every scene, clapped his hands, and instead of saying “Here is what I want from each of you,” he asked “Here is how many dead bodies I want.” It is almost cartoonish. Violence can be powerful and sizzle in the viewer’s gut, but when there is way too much of it, it loses its power and even its relevance.

To me these are quite different movies albeit in the same genre or even sub-genre. John Wick is much more classy both in John Wick’s style and the entire setting of the movie with it’s entire secret society. John Wick is also much more over the top in the action parts. Nobody is more gritty and he is slightly closer to a normal person than John Wick. The movie starts of a bit slow actually. Well, at least in my opinion. Nobody is mostly walking around moping and looking sad. He also more or less gets beaten up right away which made me get a bit concerned as to whether this was going to be a movie I liked or not. I got really concerned when he managed to get himself tasered of all things. What the f…? Luckily he picks up on the bad-assery and it gets better as the movie progresses. Towards the end it gets really good actually, first when he frees the bad guy from the burden of all that ill gotten cash and then the showdown at the little work shop where Nobody barricaded himself together with… nah, that would be a spoiler, you have to watch the movie.

I anticipated being blown away by many movies that I knew nothing about or didn\'t recognize the crew and cast involved. I expected some films to emotionally impact me so much that I\'d save them close to my heart until the very end of the year. With this said, I was unbelievably far from imagining that the very first viewing would be a heavy contender for my absolute favorite movie of the entire festival. CODA (Child Of Deaf Adults) is the first film I watch by Siân Heder, and after this session, I can\'t wait to see what she did so far and what she\'s going to do in the future. The clearly interesting premise is developed through a much more emotional narrative than I expected. From rich visual storytelling to exceptional use of sign language, Heder is able to capture something unique and deeply important to transmit to the audience and to today\'s society. The world was fortunate enough to get Sound of Metal last year, and CODA reinforces the essential message that being deaf must not be seen as a massive disability or a brutal handicap. As the movie cleverly communicates through its impeccable screenplay, having some sort of ""limitation"" doesn\'t automatically characterize someone as weird, different, or that the respective family members don\'t love each other as much or more than the so-called ""normal"" families. Except for a somewhat insignificant love relationship featuring the main character (that could have brought up an entirely different, unnecessary, and even distracting topic to the film\'s central, vital themes), I was incredibly invested in every single storyline. In fact, I find every interaction within the deaf family much more compelling and captivating than any other dialogue in the movie, and this is mostly due to the amazing performances from the cast. Leaving the protagonist to the end, Daniel Durant (Leo Rossi, brother) and Marlee Matlin (Jackie Rossi, mother) are great as supporting characters, but Troy Kotsur (Frank Rossi, father) and Eugenio Derbez (Bernardo Villalobos, music teacher) literally left me in tears with their heartfelt displays. I could feel the outstanding commitment to their roles, and I\'m delighted that Bernardo Villalobos isn\'t just another stereotypical, cliche, hysterical choir adult. However, the biggest praise in my bag must go to powerful glue that holds everything together, elevating the whole film to a whole other level: Emilia Jones as the only hearing member of the family, Ruby Rossi. First of all, I love music, and Pentatonix is actually my favorite group (acapella or not), so hearing so many wonderful voices singing together would always be a massive plus for CODA in my review. Nevertheless, not only Jones\' voice is sumptuously heartwarming, but her performance has everything an actor needs to receive acting nominations. I can\'t remember the last time I was fully invested in a single character in such an emotionally powerful manner, and Jones is definitely a major reason. A final praise to Paula Huidobro\'s visually grabbing camera work and Marius de Vries, who composed the movie\'s subtle yet efficient score and who I\'m guessing had a hand in the song choices. Either way, terrific job. CODA may very well end up as my favorite film of the 2021\'s edition of the Sundance Film Festival, and it will undoubtedly become a must-watch movie when it\'s available worldwide. Siân Heder offers her impeccable direction and beautifully written screenplay, which is packed with emotionally powerful moments that left me tearing up for the last forty-five minutes. Boasting an educative, meaningful message regarding the deaf community and what our society perceives as a tremendous handicap/disability, the characteristic visual storytelling and the captivating interactions within the deaf family prove to be incredibly investing, deeply elevating the overall piece. With the help of heartfelt, genuine performances from the supporting cast (mainly Troy Kotsur and Eugenio Derbez), Emilia Jones takes off and lands one of my favorite female performances in a long, long time. A tear-inducing, thoughtful film that I hope will conquer audiences all around the world.

This crowd-pleasing film is one of the first real gems to debut at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, and I’m still riding the wave of good vibes hours later. Being a teenager is difficult enough, but try being Ruby (Emilia Jones). The 17-year-old is the only hearing member of a deaf family, and she spends most of her spare time working on her parents’ (Marlee Matlin, Troy Kotsur) fishing boat along with her older brother, Leo (Daniel Durant). and serving as their sign language interpreter. Ruby juggles her family responsibilities, her schoolwork, and a newfound passion for her high school’s choir club (and her cute duet partner, Miles (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo)). When her music teacher (Eugenio Derbez) hears that special something in Ruby’s voice, he encourages her to think about a life beyond fishing and supports her in applying to a prestigious music school. This unfairly puts the responsibility of the household on Ruby’s shoulders, and she must choose between keeping her family afloat or pursuing her dreams. This very funny and very honest story has a universal appeal, with charming performances and a likeable family that you’ll want to spend time with. Kotsur and Matlin are terrific as Ruby’s randy parents, and Derbez brings a genuine charisma to his role as the young woman’s mentor. The cast includes three deaf actors, so much of the dialogue is expressed in sign language — and everything about that feels normal. This film goes a long way in shattering stereotypes about people who are hearing impaired, and that is to be commended. Heder has created a film that’s filled with insight, refreshingly direct dialogue, and a fully developed cast of characters that all add up to solid storytelling all around. Not only is this a coming-of-age story for Ruby, but it’s one for her family, too.

Their deafness is in no way the cause of the family woes, and much of the narrative is taken up with this family struggling to survive the decline of their livelihood, whilst she has boyfriend issues and her demanding music teacher (Eugenio Derbez) is constantly challenging to do her best. It does feature an haunting version of Joni Mitchell\'s ""Both Sides Now"" and, on occasion, we are presented with an audio appreciation from her family\'s perspective which does resonate well, giving us an inkling of how sounds sound (or not) to people who are deaf.

If there is something that manages to cause serious expression problems in the most flirtatious and fluent of men, it is the ardent gaze of the girl he loves. I know this from experience, and any man who has been in love, at least once, knows that it is not easy to choose the right moment and the right words to express the greatness and beauty of feelings. Things get worse, of course, if the man is shy or less experienced in Cupid's dealings. Then, yes, things get really complicated! Contrary to what the film might make us think, it is not necessary to be a poet to tell a beautiful woman that we love her. Well, from the little that has happened to me, what often happens is that love itself transforms us into incidental, fortuitous poets. And if the first verses are given to us by the gods, the muse of our affection easily inspires the rest. And that's how poetry is made: through the adventures and misfortunes of the heart of those who write it! This Italian production tackles these questions by facing two characters who, otherwise, might never meet: one is Mario Ruoppolo, a former fisherman who became a postman because he doesn't get along with seasickness, and who feels not being able to express how he feels about the girl he is in love with; the other is the famous Chilean communist poet Pablo Neruda, famous for his socialist verbiage and for the romantic sonnets that earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature. The contrast could not be greater: the simplicity and natural shyness of the popular man and the expressiveness and charisma of a consecrated public figure. And if one has ascendancy over the other, I cannot say that the popular man seems to have had great importance for the public figure, despite the fact that the film tries to instill it. Massimo Troisi, in addition to assisting director Michael Redford, brilliantly secures the lead role, giving Ruoppolo a balanced dose of modesty, shyness and curiosity. The only negative criticism I can make of him is the way he fades and darkens whenever he has to play with Neruda, well played by Philippe Noiret. However, it cannot be denied that the best parts of the film are the dialogues and scenes in which both are together. And in fact, the dialogues deserve a special note, for the quality and the way they were done. Renato Scarpa is irritating due to the excessive politicization of his character, which is as tiresome and repetitive as the political discourse of most communist and socialist politicians. If we listen to one in a single speech, we listen to them all in everything they might want to say. Despite not appearing much and not really having much to do, Maria Grazia Cucinotta is a welcome addition to the plot, as well as being magnificent and so beautiful that any man in the street would turn his head to admire her for longer (something that happens much to the ragazze of Italy, on account of the great merit of their beauty). Technically, the film has some merits: if the cinematography is not particularly remarkable and looks misty and aged, the scenic beauty of the filming locations and the film's sets compensates for them, with plenty of room and with an abundance of light, sun, sea, magnificent outdoor scenes and truly breathtaking landscapes. The melody also deserves a frankly positive note: in addition to fitting harmoniously with the film and each scene, it is beautiful, very well conceived and stays in the ear."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'With things unstable in his native Chile, renowned poet ""Neruda"" (Philippe Noiret) takes refuge on a small Italian island where his arrival is greeted with little more than a realisation that they are going to need to hire an extra postman! Step forward ""Mario"" (Massimo Troisi). He can barely read or write but is determined to engage the visitor in conversation and to learn from him. Initially indifferent, ""Neruda"" begins to converse with him as he delivers the daily post and when he declares he needs some help to woo the charming ""Beatrice"" (Maria Grazia Cucinotta), he finds himself with a new mentor. Now it\'s fair to say that his first attempts are maybe just a little too rough and ready. Too many references to the shapeliness of her breasts and such like, but gradually ""Mario"" learns how to express himself more fully, more characterfully, and less earthily too. This education also opens his eyes to what has been going on around him for years. His island doesn\'t even have running water and with elections looming, he finds himself drawn to a communist cause as he watches the visiting politicians make promises he knows will never be delivered. His new found political awareness doesn\'t always go down so well with his compatriots who just want to get on with their simple, maritime, lives. This adaptation of Antonio Skármeta\'s book really does imbue the characters with a generous spirit and loads of charisma. It\'s all understated, and the evolution of ""Mario"" is really well handled by Troisi who sort of co-directed with Michael Radford and with a delicately honest effort from Noiret too. The cinematography benefits hugely from the natural island scenario which at times seems to mirror the emotions being played out by the people. This is also quite an effective analysis of what constitutes poetry itself. The subtlety of the structure of the words that don\'t rely on the all-too-familiar rhymes is used to good effect.

It\'s based on his own book, so it can be relied upon to be authentic, but somehow this Martin Scorsese effort just fell flat for me. The usual mix of Robert De Niro (La Motta) with probably the least versatile actor I have ever seen on screen, Joe Pesci, as his brother Joey; Cathy Moriarty as his wife Vickie and an ensemble of Italian American co-stars just reminded me of a very much weaker ""Midnight Cowboy"" (1969). Sure, that\'s not about boxing - but I\'m not too sure how much this is about it, either. There is precious little by way of ring action - though what there is is excellently and intensively photographed - for the most part it is more of a soap opera, backed up with loads of expletives and a bit of domestic violence that seems to have come to epitomise the attitudes this New York community have for their womenfolk. There is the usual gangland, fight-fixing, shenanigans but somehow it all comes across as remarkably sterile. I don\'t really rate De Niro as an actor. Like Pesci, he only really seems to have one gear; one style and it all usually involves him playing well to his own roots, armed with a ripe vocabulary and lots of angry tantrums. At times it is shot like a television movie; the black and white imagery is just too clean and pristine. It seems to be trying for a look that places it contemporaneously in the late 1940s, but instead, for me anyway, it came across more as a film out of it\'s time. I am certain that I am in the minority here; it played to a very full cinema the other night and received applause at the end, but I am afraid I just cannot see what all the fuss is about.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Comedy', 18), ('Other', 113)]}, {'writer': 'Filipe Manuel Neto', 'score': '90%', 'review': ""One of Scorsese's best. This is considered by many to be the best boxing film made to date. And in fact it is a very well made film, where director Martin Scorsese shows all his value as a filmmaker. I don't know if we can say it's his best film, but it's certainly on the top five list. The plot revolves around the controversial sporting career of Jake “Bull” LaMotta, one of the most famous middleweight boxers of all time. At a time when sport was controlled by criminal mafias and where fights were often a hidden and manipulated betting business, LaMotta managed to succeed and become champion before his career collapsed under accusations of fight manipulation that led to the sanitation of the competitions for several years. The film portrays his journey well, but also dedicates a lot of time to showing us the violent man, coming from very humble origins and where violence is everyday, and who lives in a conflictive marriage due to constant jealousy. A man that very few could like, I dare say, he paid the price for what he experienced and finally understood the true value of violence. In fact, being such a violent film, it is obvious that children and more sensitive people should avoid it. Technically, the film is simply impeccable. The black-and-white cinematography could not be sharper, more pleasant, clear and well-framed, and the cuts made during post-production work are surgical and made with millimeter precision. With very special care for the sets and costumes, the film makes us travel through time with silky smoothness, from the 40s to the end of the following decade: without being an expert, I can say that I didn't observe any great problems with recreating eras and the sets, costumes and props are of high quality. The effects and makeup are unblemished, transforming the scenes in the ring into authentic massacres that make the real fights look like classical ballet rehearsals. I'm not sure, but I believe that, along with “Taxi Driver”, it was the film that launched Robert DeNiro's career to a level of maturity that allowed him to become the undisputed star he is today. The actor embraced the character with a commitment and dedication that is truly enviable and worthy of applause. Joe Pesci isn't far behind and does an excellent job as LaMotta's brother. In a more reserved but undoubtedly suffering role, Cathy Moriarty is very good, and we still have some room to see the elegant work of Frank Vincent or Nicholas Colasanto."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}]",100,Yes!

Sigh... This is going to be a very interesting review I actually wrote a review for this monstrosity on IMDb, but for some reason it won\'t appear on my profile... So I\'ll just write it here instead! ""Where Hands Touch"" is a 2018 historical fiction film taking place in  Nazi Germany in 1944, starring Amanda Stenberg as the main protagonist and George MacKay as her literal Nazi boyfriend! (Yayyyy! Sofun!) Anyways... Let\'s drive straight into the utter mayhem that is the plot of this film! Leyna is a biracial teenager (she\'s an Afro German) living in Nazi Germany. It\'s 1944 and somehow Leyna and her family isn\'t dead even tho her skin is clearly black. While wandering through the streets of Berlin (somehow not being caught), Leyna meets Lutz, a cute German teenager who\'s the same age as her... Who\'s also in Hitler Youth and has a Nazi father. You would think that Leyna and Lutz would be enemies (she\'s a biracial teenager living in a country where the only political party is trying to kill everyone who isn\'t white, while he\'s literallyapartof that political party that is trying to kill everyone who isn\'t white), but nope, not at all. Leyna and Lutz somehow develop aliteral romance As a history nerd, I\'ve obviously learned the topic of World War II a lot (and I meana lot), but obviously, since I am not German nor Polish nor from any of the countries that experienced the Holocaust, I don\'t know a lot about the topic of the Holocaust. So I got my Berlin-based online friend, Kiara (or Cxnnxmxn as she\'s known online), to educate me on some things about the Holocaust, Germany during that period, what the Nazis did to Jews and the Poles, ect. What\'s interesting about Kiara is that she isn\'t just German, she\'s actually HalfGermanHalfPolish, with a German father and a Polish mother. Meaning, that she is a descendant ofboththe Nazis and Holocaust victims. Hell, her grandfather was a literal nazi sympathizer who absolutely despise her parents\' relationship because of her mother\'s nationality. Despite this, they got married because he died, and that\'s how Kiara was born. So, big thanks to Kiara for helping me with this review ^^ Not only does this film openlywantyou to make you sympathize with these disgraceful human being we call the Nazis, but it also glorifies them. It\'s giving us the message that ""nOt aLL nAziS wErE bAd So We ShOuLd SyMpAtHiZe WiTh ThEm"", whichmightbe true, but that doesn\'t mean we should sympathize withallof them. Hell, Lutz isn\'t even one of the good Nazis. He\'s openly pro-Hitler, pro-war, pro-Nazi, pro-Axis, anti-Allies and anti-semetic. There\'s this one part where he doesn\'t like the smell of the concentration camp Leyna was sent to, but that doesn\'t mean he\'s automatically anti-concentration camps. I\'m pretty sure he\'s just anti-smell of the concentration camps and anti-Leyna being in a concentration camp. I\'m just way to tired to even cover the chaos that is this film\'s plot, if you wanna know the entire plot while not watching it, watch Graysons Projects\' video on the film titled ""WHY Are There So Many Nazi Sympathizer Movies?? | Where Hands Touch"" I literally don\'t understand all the good reviews at all. Like, did the people who wrote good reviews for this dumpster fire accidentally watch the satirical masterpiece that is Jojo Rabbit? Or did they think that it\'s just ""SaTiRe"" like my favorite anime, Hetalia (which, is also a satirical masterpiece). Like bruh... Everyone I\'ve met or seen that has watched this film (except Kiara and Graysons Project) has onlypositivethings to say about Okay, to be fair, it\'s okay for a German man to fall in love with a Polish woman (just ask Kiara). And it\'s also okay for a German man to fall in love with a Jew.Andit\'s also okay for a German man to fall in love with abiracialperson just like what happened with Leyna and Lutz. Obviously, love has no limits when it comes to race, religion or gender (it does have limits to age and species tho). However, the only time it isnotokay for a German to be inlove with a biracial is when the German is a legitimateNazi.

Memoir of a Snail is narrated and told from the point of view of Grace Pudel (Sarah Snook). Grace details her life story that finds humor and sentimentality in the face of depression, shortcomings, and letdowns. There are two people in the world that Grace feels comfortable with: her twin brother Gilbert (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and her best friend Pinky (Jacki Weaver). Their mother died during childbirth and their father is a drunk paraplegic who is a former street performer and animator from France. Grace developed the desire to be an animator while Gilbert wants to be a street performer. After their father passes away, the twins are separated and put into foster homes in two separate states. They spend the majority of the film writing letters to one another and dreaming of the day that they can reunite. As an adult, Grace meets Pinky. Pinky wears giant, red-rim glasses, is covered in wrinkles and liver spots, and habitually smokes cigars. She has traveled all over the world, met countless people, been with only a handful of memorable men, and has lived a crazy life full of no regrets or dull moments. She quickly becomes Grace’s best friend. Grace becomes obsessed with snails at a young age. She keeps live ones as pets in a jar and buys every snail-related knickknack she can get her hands on. She also likes to read trashy romance novels and is constantly eating Chiko Rolls, which are spring rolls that are the size of burritos. If you haven’t seen Mary and Max or his 2003 Academy Award-winning short Harvie Krumpet, Adam Elliot’s stop-motion animated style isn’t as smooth and polished as recent Laika or Aardman films have become. Elliot’s stop-motion still looks like it was hand-crafted by humans – visible balls of clay that have been molded into these soul-driven characters that we eventually grow to love. It would have been extremely easy for Adam Elliot to make Memoir of a Snail into a film that emotionally destroys the audience and never looks back. However, the film is written in a way that makes you feel an entire spectrum of emotions over a mere 90 minutes. Anyone who grew up as a loner will sympathize with Grace, especially when devoting your life to collecting something you love. But her story is presented in a way that allows you to laugh at all the terrible things in her life. The characters in the film, no matter how much screen time they’re given, are loaded with eccentricities. There’s a bum who lost his job as a court judge because he liked to masturbate in court, the foster family Gilbert is sent to is a wildly religious one complete with gibberish prayers and apple worshipping, and Grace falls in love with a man in the neighborhood while he’s using his leaf blower. Surprisingly, Memoir of a Snail is R-rated. There’s some mild vulgarity in there and repeated use of the middle finger, but there’s also a shocking amount of nudity. Grace’s foster family has this boring front of designing traffic lights. They create awards for her every week and hang them on her wall to get her to stop being sad about being separated from her brother. But they’re also swingers who like to take exotic vacations purely driven based on having sex with new people in a new place. Memoir of a Snail is an animated film that is as enjoyable on an emotional level as a thought-provoking one. The film has several life lessons that stick with you afterward. Grace, Gilbert, and their father all wrestle with feeling caged in throughout the film, but the difference is who feels like a glass half full, a glass half empty, and just a glass. Made on a rapid 32-week shooting schedule where animators had to complete 10 seconds a day to finish on time, Memoir of a Snail is a small-budget animated film that feels like a handmade labor of love.

Indeed, by an early age “Grace” is really only happy living in her room with her collection of gastropods. There’s a lovely melancholy to this story and the dialogue is riddled with typically Australian epithets, sarcasm and very dry wit as the tale of woes upon woes upon more woes is engagingly unfolded over the next ninety minutes, but it’s the astonishing detail of the animation that really stands out here. Right from the beginning, as we tour a home that looks more like an old curiosity shop we see not just great detail amongst the mechanics of the imagery, but there’s plenty of more subtle content hidden in plain sight for us to spot and frequently raise a smile at, too. There’s an enjoyably compelling attraction from her downbeat monologues as she lurches from bad news to more bad news and I thought it had shades of the Tim Burton too it as it edged towards it’s denouement. It’s really superbly crafted artistry this, and though it does put a smiley face on things, it also takes quite a poignant look at family and loneliness too.

Cameron could probably have potted more if it wasn\'t for his earnest, simplistic messages (rich bad; nature good). All three movies (Titanic,Avatar,Avengers) plot along comfortably then suddenly spike spectacularly. But no one has ever laid on the cinematic charm and cajolery like Stephen Spielberg. He was by far the craftiest manipulator of action and melodrama there ever was. He was the progenitor of summer blockbusters and all-ages, all-nations spectacles. At his best he had a gift for re-living and realizing that ethereal and irresistible childhood awe. IfRaiders of the Lost Ark(NOT the sequels... NO, not even the father- son one) was made today, exactly the same way, okay maybe in 3D with updated CGI, it would surely land at the top of the box-office heap. It is essentially the first comic book movie that wasn\'t a comic book (bespectacled mild-mannered Archaeology prof by day and globe-trotting whip-wielding action hero on sabbatical).Raiders of the Lost Ark(the first and only) is arguably the greatest adventure movie ever cooked up. And we, the abject audience, servile participants of the artifice, were licking its boots. We wanted Spielberg and his Indy to rope us in, reel us into the action, and completely have their way with us. We overlooked the emotional manipulation and contrived trappings because it was a pure freaking joy to watch, a Lucas produced godsend. Harrison Ford was born to play it just as Steven was born to direct it. It\'s really too bad they had to brand and knock off inferior sequels that, while making oodles of money, tarnished the shine of the unsurpassed prototype. Indiana Jones was the perfect reluctant action hero on a selfless mission. A whip-snapping, truck-wrangling, swordster-gunning, Nazi- brawling adventurer who was matched only by his headstrong and sassy love interest, one pistol of a gal who could drink any man under the table. Not enough credit has been given to the great Lawrence Kasdan as the writer of this marvellous adventure. The script is as close to perfect as anybody could scribe. Even a dialogue-heavy expository scene (poisoned dates) was infused with a tense element of suspense. Yes, the story was hyper-fictional, completely contrived, shamelessly far-fetched... and altogether delightful. I wasn\'t expecting much when I went in to watch it back in 1981, but it had me wanting to do do back-flips on the way out. America\'s own Fab Four, Larry, Steve, Harrison and George, put on an action-adventure clinic. Possibly the only weak spot in the movie is the climax which had our hero and heroine tied to a stake while God, the almighty Mcguffin from the Old Testament, magically wrapped things up for them. ""Don\'t look"" Indy warns, with his patented crooked grin. Are you kidding? We can\'t possibly take out eyes off of this.

The dolphins are not just killed, they are in fact slaughtered in the most brutal way imaginable. And all this without anyone really knowing that it goes on. I've heard of dolphins being killed in the nets when they catch tuna, but I've never thought that people actually hunted down dolphins as a source of food. Dolphins, like any whale really, seem a bit too majestic and mysterious to just slaughter like pigs and cows, at least to me. And if this movie is to be believed, they can also be quite dangerous to eat, as they contain a high amount of mercury. This movie is a documentary, focused around a signle event, where we actually see the slaughter of the dolphins. We see how the crew set up the cameras in the middle of the night, as well as how they scout out the area and plan the entire event. But more interesting than all that, we also meet Ric O'berry, one of the original actors and trainers from the tv show Flipper, who has now devoted his life to stopping the killing and abuse of dolphins. Being part of Flipper, and the one who actually caught the dolphins to appear on that show, he feels personal responsible for starting this whole mess. Of course, it would most likely have happened anyways, but we feel his pain. As a documentary, this is really well made. It is constructed much like a movie, but doesn't become too emotional, except at the very end, where we see Ric telling his story to the world, silently and with a screen on his belly. Last words... I am not a big dolphin lover or anything, but this movie still got to me by the end, because... this seems so pointless.

Facing the hostility of the locals and the authorities, the team are determined to capture video evidence of this atrocity and so using state of the art technology and quite a bit of legerdemain, they attempt to infiltrate the highly secure locale to obtain it. In the course of their planning, we are made aware of the role the International Whaling Commission has in policing the fishing of cetaceans around the world, and plausible assertions are made that Japan is using financial and economic muscle to attract new members to it's fold so they can have it's long-term bans reversed or a least modified. We are also advised of the dangers of mercury within the food chain, and of the dangers of consuming dolphin meat as children - frequently when it is ill-defined on the packaging and/or disguised as something else. There's fairly clear complicity from the authorities demonstrated here, usually presented in the name of tradition and to an extent this documentary rather sneers at that. These are centuries-old fishing communities that quite possibly have always fished like this. That's not to excuse their current, brutal, practices - but what this does lack is a little of the historical context in which these fishermen behave and which might possibly explain some of their government's broader strategy in a nation that looks, like many other island nations, to the sea for the bulk of it's food.

In a Swedish country house, the dying Agnes (Harriet Andersson) is visited by her two sisters, the sensual and impulsive Karin (Liv Ullmann), and the stern and frigid Maria (Ingrid Thulin). Though ostensibly there to comfort Agnes in her last days, they are essentially just waiting for her to die, as they are too more preoccupied with their unhappy marriages, their mysterious personal feud, and the specifics of dividing up the estate. It falls to Agnes' devoted maid Anna (Kari Sylwan) to provide any human warmth. One of the most emotionally touching aspects of the film is this contrast between the selfless love of a member of a despised underclass and the indifference (or outright disgust) expressed by Agnes' own family. Bergman had made the transition to colour film with En Pasion of three years earlier, but Viskningar och rop finally exploits its possibilities. Red is ever present on screen, whether in the red wing of the house in which Agnes lies dying, the red transitions between scenes, or the vivid blood that flows in each of the sisters' flashbacks to the decay of their marriages. Sven Nykvist's cinematography is, as always, brilliant. And though one doesn't often think of the makeup artist in a Bergman film, whoever worked on this one deserves praise for making such a glamorous actress as Harriet Andersson (still in her late 30s then and quite glamorous) look convincingly decrepit. Bergman considered Viskningar och rop one of his two greatest films, along with 1966's Persona. I must say, however, that I have never ranked it so highly. While Viskningar och rop continues to amaze me on every viewing, Viskningar och rop does tend to exhaust its overt symbolism and interpersonal dynamics right away, and I rarely come back to it. Furthermore, I feel Bergman wove too much of this film out of what had become stock gestures for him, such as incestuous siblings, and a man speaking about the need to trust God when he himself has lost faith."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 78), ('Comedy', 27), ('Romance', 22), ('Documentary', 13), ('Other', 53)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '60%', 'review': 'There are certainly some very strong performances in this rather downbeat drama from Ingmar Bergman.

The two sisters are pretty taciturn with each other; neither have particularly happy nor fulfilling marriages and the film uses the decline of ""Agnes"" as a conduit to reflect on their past lives, loves and on their own relationships. Thulin is particularly effective here, but the undercurrents of resentment between the siblings and their spouses (and the doctor Erland Josephson) are presented with a bleakness that I found all rather sterile. Watching their strife, I could not say that I was immersed with any feeling of involvement in their scenarios. Certainly the acting is penetrative, the intimate (though sometimes quite clunky) moving photography adds richness to the performances; but I found the story to be devoid of much humanity.

Heat is written and directed by Michael Mann. It stars Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Ashley Judd, Amy Brennerman and Danny Trejo. Music is scored by Elliot Goldenthal and cinematography by Dante Spinoti. Big time thief Neil McCauley (DeNiro) is after one last major score before he retires, but hot on his tail is Vincent Hannah (Pacino), a cop equally and methodically as driven as he is himself. In the build up to Heat's release, much was made of it being the first on screen pairing of DeNiro and Pacino. A mouthwatering prospect for sure, it proved to be worth the wait and unfolds as a lesson in restrained acting with two modern greats affording each other the respect that was due. What we didn't realise in the build up to the film's release, was that it would prove to be one of the greatest cops and robbers movies of all time, brought to us by an auteur director whose kink for realism and commitment to research stands him out from much of the modern directing pack. Rarely does a film come together as one, where all the cogs of the engine are in tune, but Heat is one such picture. From cast performances to visual aesthetics, to screenplay and actual substance of story, Heat is as meticulous as it is thrilling. There are a myriad of characters brilliantly stitched together in one de-glamorised City of Angels, as plot develops, and each character and their crumbling relationships come under inspection, we are witnessing a coarse viewpoint of human nature, where people's lives are ended or defined by their choices. Everywhere you look, here, there are folk cracking under the strain of being exposed to high end crime, dreams, hopes and happiness are unlikely to be achieved, and this is on both sides of the law. For Heat, Mann fuses the tonal and visual ticks of Manhunter with that of the adrenalin rushes from Last of the Mohicans, with the former gorgeously born out by Spinoti's pin sharp photography, the latter thrillingly realised by Mann's skill at action set pieces. Once again word of mouth about the key heist and shoot out in the film led to high expectation, and again there is no disappointment. L.A. becomes a battle ground, rapid gunfire punctures the air, cars swerve and crash, bodies fall, visually and aurally it drags you to the edge of your seat, an extended action sequence fit to sit with the best of them. The kicker as well is that because Mann has been so detailed in his characterisations, we care about what happens to all parties, we understand motives and means. Which in a film with such a huge support cast is quite an achievement.

If there's one thing that can be a good pastime, it's an action movie, with ingenious and fearless thieves and police willing to do anything to arrest them. That's what this movie is, basically, and although we've seen many movies with this recipe, neither does it become tiresome, nor do the movies become boring or less interesting. Michael Mann is today a director with solid action credits, thanks in part to this film, but also to “The Insider” and “Collateral”. Before this film, he had shown extraordinary competence in directing “Last of the Mohicans”, a film that I consider an example for harmonizing creative freedom, absolute historical rigor and a great respect for the source material. In this film, Mann does not disappoint and once again gives us solid, consistent, committed and creative direction. For the cast, several great actors with given evidence were called. Of course, it's not possible for everyone to have the same degree of protagonism, but I think that each one of them had the time and material necessary to do a very well done job. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro clearly stand out from the crowd. In addition to having the central characters of the plot, they are both incredibly intense, charismatic, explosive. It's worth watching this duel of the titans. Pacino is the most unlikable and difficult to like because he is constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown. De Niro is kinder and more human, so it's not hard to root for him. In addition to them, we have the excellent work of Val Kilmer and Jon Voight, and a well accomplished performance of Tom Sizemore. The film also features appearances by Danny Trejo (almost playing himself) and a teenager named Natalie Portman, among many other well-known names. Despite everything, this film has little action, many will say. And really, the priority that was given here is the development of the characters and each of their stories, so that the action is more concentrated in some specific sequences like the anthological sequence of the robbery and shooting in the middle of the street. I liked that, and I liked that this movie tried to be different in a positive way. My only criticism is the slow and tiresome pace that the film assumes most of the time. With a slightly faster pace thanks to some surgical cuts, the film would become lighter. Filmed in Los Angeles, in the city itself (I can only imagine what a logistical nightmare it must have been!), the film couldn't have better sets and costumes, striving for total realism.

Then, one tiny slip-up during an armoured car robbery gives the tenacious detective a glimmer of hope that might just lead the cops to one of his number. Meantime, on the personal front “Vincent” is having trouble engaging with his wife “Justine” (Diane Venore) who is sick of his constant absences and late shift work, whilst the determinedly bachelor that is “McAuley” befriends a girl in a diner and “Charlene” (Ashley Judd) soon gets under his skin, giving him a new reason to reassess what he wants from life. It’s all going to come down to one last job, and with the police now breathing down their neck it’s going to be a matter of wile, guile and wits as to which might prevail - and Michael Mann manages to build and then sustain quite a degree of tension leading to an exciting last twenty minutes whilst still keeping the jeopardy going right to the end. There are quite a few solid veins of sub-plots contributing here, too, that allow Val Kilmer and Kevin Gage to take some of the limelight and relieve a little of the burgeoning tension between De Niro and Pacino, and though I did think the latter man here did overact annoyingly at times, the whole ensemble delivers a superior heist movie that just goes to show that it’s never the actual robbing that causes the problems, it’s the getting away with it.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Comedy', 18), ('Other', 113)]}]",100,Yes!

Washizu (the Macbeth character, Toshiro Mifune) is a soldier serving the lord of Spiders-Web Castle. While riding through a forest with his comrade and childhood friend Miki (the Banquo character, Minoru Chiaki), they come upon a forest spirit that foretells an elevation in rank for the two, and eventually Washizu's reign over Spiders-Web Castle. While Washizu denies that he has any desire to seize the throne, the forest spirit could see into his heart, as can his wife Asaji (the Lady Macbeth character, Isuzu Yamada) who spurs him on to murder any potential rivals. Thus Mifune moves inextricably towards his own elevation, but also his own fall. Although the film is an adaptation of Shakespeare, the way the actors move before the camera owes much to the Japanese theatre called Noh. So much of the film is carried by the powerful facial expressions of the main actors: the over-the-top snarls and gasps of Mifune; the sad mien of Chiaki, as if his character is already aware of his fate; and the chilling calm of Yamada, a coldblooded killer even if she doesn’t personally murder anyone but has others do it. Kurosawa's set design is elaborate, one really feels back in Edo Japan. Furthermore, by shooting the film in a bleak part of Japan with abundant fog, the landscape powerfully mirrors the predicament in which the characters find themselves. This is one of those films that any Westerners with a solid liberal arts education (by which I mean at least some general knowledge of Macbeth) should see and will probably enjoy. Because it is based on a universal theme that just happened to be so well packaged by Shakespeare, the plot is straightforward and engaging in spite of the exotic setting. But because viewers can so easily follow that plot, the feudal Japan dressing with its distinct mores will prove a fascinating touch, and Kurosawa has depicted this world in rich detail. I don't know if postwar scarcity was still a thing in 1956 when Kurosawa shot Throne of Blood, but it seems like no expense was spared here."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 78), ('Comedy', 27), ('Romance', 22), ('Documentary', 13), ('Other', 53)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'I think that this is a superb tragi-adventure story that stands out well amongst the numerous loose adaptations of Shakespeare that have been made over the years.

Toshirô Mifune is magnificent as ""Washizu"" who after getting lost with his colleague (Minoru Chiaki) in the doleful ""Spider\'s Web"" forest is given a cryptic prophecy that one day he too is destined to rule the great ""Spider\'s Web castle""... Initially reluctant to embark on this path, he soon becomes blinded by this ambition on the misguided advice of his wife (Isuzu Yamada) and so he sets out on a despotic path than can only end in disaster for everyone. The cast work the story well, ably aided by the eeriness of the sets and a sharp pace. It works far better, in my opinion, in monochrome - no colourful distractions from the moody cinematography of the forest nor of the castle architecture and the mobilisation of grand armies - especially in the scenes set in winter; and the general grittiness of the scenarios are easily akin to those of 11th Century Scotland. Once the delirium of the final scenes is upon us, the performances become plausible and in the end , I almost felt sorry for ""Washizu"".

A typhoon struck the set in the Philippines, local officials were difficult to work with, Martin Sheen had a heart attack during filming, and Coppola was constantly troubled how to bring his script to a powerful ending. The 1991 documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker\'s Apocalypse chronicles these trials and tribulations through audio recordings that Coppola\'s wife Eleanor made for her filming diary, informal footage of life on the set and interviews with cast and crew. If all Hearts of Darkness did was rehash the same general trivia one can get from Wikipedia, like so many documentaries, it wouldn\'t be very good. I was pleased to find that it reveals a lot about the story that I never knew before. The genesis of the screen adaption of Joseph Conrad\'s novel in earlier attempts by Orson Welles and George Lucas is charted. Dennis Hopper\'s maniacal performance is placed in the context of his own nervousness at a career slump and his thankfulness that Coppola was giving him a second chance. Perhaps the strongest point of the film is how it reveals the mind of someone tormented by his drive to create, and how a film can result from spontaneous choices on set that go far beyond any script. When the film was first shown at Cannes, Coppola said of the production ""little by little we went insane"", and indeed his highs of inspiration and lows of self-doubt are captured here. The opening of the film where Sheen\'s character drunkenly breaks a mirror and slumps, bleeding and crying next to his hotel room bed, is shown to have resulted from the cameras rolling when Sheen did drunkenly stumble on set. Upon its 1991 release this documentary must have been even more interesting as it contains much footage that appeared only in the Apocalypse Now Redux director\'s cut in 2001: the French Plantation scene, the interlude in the abandoned, muddy camp, etc. I was surprised to hear Coppola insist on cutting the French Plantation scene because he was unsatisfied with the quality of the French actors and the lighting, not because of its place in the story. But what remains remarkable about Hearts of Darkness is that it betrays nothing of the scenes out of the 5-hour workprint that remain cut from commercial release, such as the prominent role given to Lt. Colby and his murder of the American photographer. There\'s also absolutely no shots of Harvey Keitel as Captain Williard before he was replaced.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 78), ('Comedy', 27), ('Romance', 22), ('Documentary', 13), ('Other', 53)]}, {'writer': 'Wuchak', 'score': '90%', 'review': 'Outstanding documentary on the making of the hallowed ""Apocalypse Now"" Released in 1991, ""Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker\'s Apocalypse"" chronicles the making of 1979\'s ""Apocalypse Now,"" combining footage shot by Eleanor Coppola during the shooting of the film with more recent interviews with the cast & crew. Documentaries or commentaries on how a particular film was made don\'t interest me because I\'m not a filmmaker and only care about the final product. As a writer and former musician I\'m familiar with the creative process and understand how some ideas fail to deliver the goods and must be thrown out, etc. As an example, I heard some demos of a couple of my favorite songs and they were lousy compared to the final product and almost ruined my view of those songs. This explains why I\'m generally not interested in the harrowing details of how my favorite movies were made and the parts that were thrown out, etc. This documentary is an exception because (1.) ""Apocalypse Now"" is my all-time favorite movie (the original theatrical version, that is) and (2.) the documentary is just so well-done. In fact, it\'s fascinating from beginning to end. ""Hearts of Darkness"" shows the monumental problems Coppola and crew encountered in making the movie: The sudden firing of their leading man (Harvey Keitel) after three weeks of shooting and replacing him with Martin Sheen; the delays in filming due to the Philippine Army taking back their rented helicopters to quell an uprising; a hurricane that ruins the sets; Sheen having a heart attack at only 36 years of age and the corresponding delay; overweight Brando arriving to the set unprepared and making $1 million a week with an unwritten, improvised ending; the amusing tiger incident; Francis venting in genuine uncertainty at various stages of the creative process, particularly the entire ending; etc. The interviews with cast and crew are also very informative and entertaining, like Frederic Forrest\'s commentary on the tiger sequence and John Milius\' insights on his original screenplay and his encounter with Francis during filming where the latter convinced him that it\'d be ""the first film to win the Nobel prize."" This documentary came out ten years before the ""Redux"" version of the film was released and, as such, it was the public\'s first glimpse of various scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor, like the French Plantation sequence and the typhoon-with-the-bunnies sequence. In my opinion, ""Redux"" is a failure and those scenes should\'ve never been inserted into the movie as very little of the added footage works, but those sequences ARE interesting as deleted scenes or viewing them (in part) in the context of ""Hearts of Darkness.""

This is the last film in Krzysztof Kieslowski's “trilogy of colors”, and focuses on the unusual friendship between a young and beautiful catwalk model and an elderly retired judge who entertains himself by listening, illegally and without no one knows, the telephone conversations of the neighbors. Why? Out of sheer cynicism. He is a man alone, bitter and unhappy. What follows is a trip in which both characters will go through very similar situations. The film continues to have notable points in terms of cinematography, sets and costumes. As in the previous films, the title color is present in all scenes and is persistently part of the sets and props. Despite being elegant, the music is intense, almost a prop for the scene, and contributes to the overall harmony of the work. As in the previous films, the duo of central actors is responsible for an interpretive tour de force, which is absorbing and impressive: Irene Jacob is an excellent actress, but it turns out to be Jean-Louis Trintignant who stands out the most. The script is quite interesting, for the way it explores the cynicism of the judge's character, and for the way it addresses interpersonal relationships, the honesty and sincerity of love and relationships, the application of the law and the moral and philosophical consequences of judgments. humans.

The camera loves her face, her eyes and her facial expressions and she uses that tool to convey an whole gamut of emotions effectively. Shvorin also delivers well as his character introduces a little of the manipulative and the cowardly bully to a scenario that extols the virtues of family and community but not in a perfect fashion. People adapt to circumstances in individual ways. The photography has an observational intensity to it that at times makes you feel like you ought not to be watching at all, particularly in the hospital where ""Uncle Fyodor"" (Vasily Merkurev) is constantly dealing with casualties amongst both his patients and his staff!

""Blanche"" is largely confined to a wheelchair, so is entirely dependent on her increasingly alcoholic, flaky and downright nasty sibling. Thing is, though, it\'s Blanche who has the money - and when she starts to discuss selling their house this riles her sister who soon has some pretty menacing thoughts about thwarting this ""betrayal"". Luckily for ""Blanche"" - their maid ""Elvira"" (Maidie Norman) starts to become aware of this rather menacing change in attitude, and well... Crawford and Davis are very much at the top of their games here, and somehow you can\'t help but wonder if they were really acting their socks off, or whether there was a serious bit of professional ""loathing"" going on on the set of this deftly directed Robert Aldrich classic. There is a positive sense of venom here from Davis, and her counterpart portrays the traumatised victim with great aplomb. Neither woman is afraid to ditch their more traditional glamour. Davis looks truly demented in her part as the woman with one hand on the bottle and the other on the door handle of the sanatorium - and she excels in the part.

I can\'t say much about Roman Polanski because I feel I\'ve seen too little of his work to make a more global analysis: I have only seenThe Ninth Gate,The Pianistand, now, this film. It\'s not much… but the truth is that they are three films that I really liked, and about which I have a very good opinion. This film is very good, fitting into a style that we can call “neo-noir”, insofar as its visual aesthetic is heavily inspired by noir, with the caveats that are due, as it is a color film and not black and white. Polanski is an attentive and meticulous director, who provides the audience with quality work, in which every detail has been thought of. With a story set in San Francisco during the 1930s, the film is very similar to the gangster movies that came out in the 40\'s and 50\'s. The story revolves around a private detective, an ex-cop, who is hired to watch a man in what appears to be just another case of adultery. Everything changes when he discovers that the woman who hired him is not a jealous wife. The search for answers will lead him to a web of intrigue and crimes that involves an important Californian company and a public works contract that can be decisive for the city\'s water storage. It\'s an excellent story, capable of holding us in the first few minutes and that harmoniously combines tension, romance and suspense, in the right measures. In addition to an excellent story, with a very well written script, the film presents us with a high quality cast headed by Jack Nicholson, at a time when he was still young and elegant enough to play heartthrob roles. The actor is very good and leaves in this film one of the most interesting works of his career. Faye Dunaway is not far behind and is simply wonderful, dignified and elegantly seductive, as a “femme fatale” should be. John Huston (Nicholson\'s father-in-law in real life, at this time) also appears in the film and makes a very positive and interesting participation. In addition to these qualities, the film also has superb production values: impeccably shot, with great angles and sharpness, it has very good cinematography, beautiful colors and light and shadow effects, in addition to excellent sepia tones that are called reinforcing the dominant ""vintage"" ambience. The film was a very detailed production, in which special attention was given to the creation of the sets and the choice of filming locations, so that everything fit well into the historical period. The choice of cars (which are important in the course of the plot) and the design of the costumes and props was also very careful.

Nicholson is also on super form, his performance is natural and engaging with a solid chemistry between his and Dunaway adding a richness to this rather quirky plot. Roman Polanski has assembled a strong supporting cast - notably John Huston who features sparingly but effectively as her wealthy, untrustworthy, father ""Noah"" and the photography does a great deal to help generate a sense of accumulating intrigue as we gradually make some headway through this complicated and interesting character study. The production looks great - the 1930s costume and motor cars alongside a smattering of the simmering attitudes that prevailed at the time are encapsulated well too.

This movie is totally forgotten these days. Well, actually, if you're not native or very close to Ireland, I think the very existence and action of the IRA seems like something that ended many years ago, and it doesn't. It was a recent thing, and it still has marks on people and society. The film focuses, in particular, on the case of the “Guildford Four” and the “Maguire Seven”, which was a group of people who were accused of a bomb attack and of collaborating with the IRA, later proving to be if they were all innocent. The acquittal, however, came too late for the family patriarch, who died in prison. The accused were, almost all, related to each other, family or friendship. I don't know the facts very well, although I did read something about the attack and the real case the film was based on, in order to better prepare myself to understand the film and be able to talk about it. As far as I can tell, the film obviously took a lot of liberties to make the story more appealing and dramatic, but nothing that is shockingly out of line with what happened. Daniel Day Lewis was still relatively young here, but he was already showing signs of great talent. He is a focused actor and very responsible with his work, who dedicates himself to what he does and commits himself to the character. And we can see how he adapts to the character, and makes it real and believable and human. I also really enjoyed Pete Postlethwaite's work. I think it's particularly notable the way he allowed himself to age in order to play an older, physically impaired character. Technically, the film is very worthy in its effort to portray the ordeal to which the convicts were subjected, and it does so in a very convincing and credible way. The choice of sets, filming locations and costumes contribute a lot to this.

The film exposes us to the shock that the terrorism law at this time could have exposed any innocent person for 7 days without charge, and I believe that it is still present in many countless countries on the globe. The film talks about the true story of the Quartet of Guildford and the Seven of Maguire, a very painful human rights story whose chapters begin with the arrest of the Irish young man Gerry Conlon in England and accusing him, along with three others, of carrying out a terrorist attack to bomb a bar in Guildford. Although Jerry is reckless and has criminal tendencies already, but through the events of the film we realize that Jerry and those with him are innocent, but the investigation and interrogation process shows that it has many impurities and corruption in how to accuse these innocent people. In the Name of the Father, on the surface, talks about justice and the feeling of oppression in the face of injustice. The events of the film are dramatic, revolving around other topics, the most important of which is the relationship between the son and the father and how it develops, as well as how an ugly place such as prison can constitute an opportunity for Jerry to mature in a way that would not have happened if he had not been subjected to injustice. The multiplicity and diversity of the dimensions of the film, in addition to manifestations outside the capabilities of the planet in two scenes and the performance of two actors, who gave the film great importance and a special place for me. If there was an Oscar for best acting duo, the Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite partnership would have given them blindfolded. The character of Giuseppe Conlon has no faults. Even the story of his name, which allowed a wonderful scene to be told, was charming and incredible. He had a strange state of coherence in light of the circumstances in which he was, and in light of his background full of downwardness, which made him follow the rules and laws strictly so as not to violate the law. This flatness made his son Jerry view him as a weakness. But when Jerry realized when he tested himself in facing the same challenges his father faced, he saw his father, Giuseppe Conlon, gain ground and respect in every situation.

Along the way, we find ourselves in a semi-comical environment as the three make progress - almost despite themselves. Confused, yes? Muddled? Yes, that too - but the sum of the three individuals proves to be worth far more than the value of each part. They function as a team because they shouldn\'t - and that is where much of the humour and the potency of the drama comes from. The animation is stylish and the hues and shades are particularly effective at illustrating their environment and at complimenting the humorous elements of their detective work. For some, 2022 attitudes may show up some of the character cracks that would have been groundbreaking at the start of this new millennium, but given it was made when it was - it tackles quite a few issues with a candour - and vivacity - that all works well to create an entertaining, charming and at times just a little thought-provoking animation.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Comedy', 18), ('Other', 113)]}]",100,Yes!

His family once had a guava orchard, but his poet and philosopher father ""Harihar"" (Kanu Bannerjee) had to trade that in to square up his profligate brother\'s debts. That now means that his mother ""Sarbojaya"" (Karuna Bannerjee) has to try to keep food on the table for them, his pilfering sister ""Durga"" (Uma Das Gupta) and their resident elderly aunt ""Indir"" (Chunibala Devi) - and that\'s not a task she relishes! With nothing much coming in, her\'s is the job of scraping together the means of buying food and living with the disdain of her neighbours. Finally, ""Harihar"" concludes that he must go and find work - so off he goes leaving the family to fend for themselves - and all of this with the monsoon season looming large over their dilapidated home. Being the first of a trilogy, this is much more of an establishing exercise - we get to meet the constituent parts of this happy but strained and frequently quarrelsome family; we see just how hand-to-mouth their existence is; we experience some of the culture of shame that is visited on those less fortunate - and we also get to appreciate the stoicism of a family with very little prospect of light at the end of their tunnel. What really adds richness to this story is the photography. It\'s so intimate in it\'s presentation. Everything here looks spontaneous and natural, the antics of the children - especially the fruit stealing sister; the boys playing and cavorting around. Even the constant bickering between aunt and mother comes across as entirely convincing. The jigsaw puzzle of his life is only gradually being put together, but you can sense that ""Apu"" is in for some adventures as he strives for a better life for him and his family, and even at a young age we all see his potential, and the potential for him to fail. I saw a 16mm print of this recently and though the subtitles had faded slightly, it was quite an astonishing production to watch and as an observation of subsistence life, it\'s really quite poignant.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Comedy', 18), ('Other', 113)]}]",100,Yes!

You\'re a cheap, lousy, dirty, stinkin\' mug! And I\'m glad what I done to you, ya hear that? I\'m glad what I done! On the Waterfront is directed by Elia Kazan and adapted to screenplay by Budd Schulberg from a series of Malcolm Johnson articles. It stars Marlon Brando, lee J. Cobb, Eva Marie Saint, Karl Malden, Rod Steiger and Pat Henning. Music is by Leonard Bernstein and cinematography by Boris Kaufman. Terry Malloy (Brando) was once a boxer with potential and big dreams. Now working as a longshoreman on the docks for mob boss Johnny Friendly (Cobb), Terry witnesses the murder of a fellow dock worker and finds himself conflicted about if he should inform to the crime commission about what he knows, more so as he gets in tight with the dead man\'s sister. As good as anything Kazan, Brando and Kaufman ever did, On the Waterfront strips it down to a stench filled corrupt part of New York as honest hard working men battle to make ends meet under the rule of corrupt mob led union bosses. The dialogue is almost lyrical in its simplicity, deftly at odds with the dull pallor of the environment involving barely livable housing and misty docks holding awful secrets. Although a defence for squealing, with the finger pointed at those in the high chairs here, it\'s a seminal classic that deserved every Oscar win and nomination that it got. From the electric ""contender"" speech (watch Steiger\'s facial acting here), to Brando\'s heart aching discovery of his beloved bids being killed, and onto the unforgettable punch the air finale, thisis a s good as classic cinema gets. 10/10', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 43), ('Thriller', 42), ('Crime', 34), ('Action', 29), ('Other', 111)]}, {'writer': 'James', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'This coulda’ been a contender in a lot of greatest movie polls if people just took a second to fully appreciate it.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 59), ('Comedy', 35), ('Crime', 23), ('Thriller', 23), ('Other', 119)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'Although it\'s Marlon Brando who takes top billing here, I found it was Karl Malden\'s ""Father Barry"" who stole the story as the priest who is determined to galvanises the New York dockers to step out from under the oppressive shadow of their boss ""Johnny Friendly"" (Lee J. Cobb). He\'s standing over a corpse, that of ""Doyle"". The deceased had been reputedly chatting with the crime commissioner and so took an unexpected dive off his building. He was a pigeon fancier, and it was this hobby that we know ""Malloy"" (Brando) used to lure the man to his pen on the roof. We know, but the late man\'s sister ""Edie"" (Eva Marie Saint) doesn\'t. As she determines to get to the bottom of the crime, she and ""Malloy"" start to become closer. He even begins to fall in love - but the priest tells him that can come to nothing unless he is honest. ""Malloy"" knows full well that any honesty will set him on a collision course with ""Johnny"" and with his own, cashmere coat clad brother ""Charlie"" (Rod Steiger) who acts as the number two around here. A meeting at the church does motivate ""Dugan"" (Pat Henning) to try to do something about this increasingly unfair scenario, but when he has a little too much whisky, it falls to ""Barry"" to render up his soliloquy and the dial starts to shift. If you\'ve seen Charles Frend\'s ""The Cruel Sea"" (1953) you might recall a scene where, their ship torpedoed, the men float around in the water - water covered in debris and oil. It\'s dark and menacing looking. The photography here is almost that dark. It\'s black and white with the emphasis very much not the former. The photography almost seems to magnetise the darker elements of the buildings, the water and bring them to the fore. They become claustrophobic. Cobb is impressive as the boss as is Eve Marie Saint who avoids many of the usual pitfalls for the female lead. Her character is strong and her courage palpable in the face of an increasingly dangerous and desperate scenario. The denouement is gripping, touching and entirely fitting snd if you can get a chance to see this on a big screen, then do - it is a roller-coaster of a film that imbues it\'s flawed characters with personality and us with a sense of having some skin in it\'s game.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Comedy', 18), ('Other', 113)]}, {'writer': 'Wuchak', 'score': '60%', 'review': 'Popular quasi-film noir early in Brando’s career A former prize-fighter (Marlon) wrestles with his conscience as a longshoreman on the Hudson River across from Manhattan and the Empire State Building. He finds himself attracted to the sister (Eva Marie Saint) of a murdered dockworker while his lawyer brother (Rod Steiger) defends the corrupt Union boss (Lee J. Cobb). Karl Malden is on hand as a concerned local minister. ""On the Waterfront"" (1954) is an iconic B&W crime drama that won myriad awards when it came out. It’s a seminal socio-political noir and one of Brando’s three big hits in the early 50s, along with “A Streetcar Named Desire” and, less so, “The Wild One.” I cite those movies because this is cut from the same cloth, just with the milieu of the Hoboken docks in the shadow of the Big Apple. Why it’s not included on lists of film noir is a mystery. Although it’s understandably old-fashioned and a little melodramatic, there’s enough human interest, especially the potential romance, and you can’t beat the authentic setting. I particularly like the rooftop perspective with skyscrapers in the distance in many scenes (reminiscent of Spider-Man comics from the 1960s-1980s). The flick supports being a “stoolpigeon” against corruption and was director Elia Kazan’s answer to those who denounced him for identifying eight Communists in the industry before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952. Despite its renown, Brando seems pudgy and somewhat unappealing. I thought he improved in later (better) movies, like “Désirée,” “The Young Lions,” “One-Eyed Jacks” and “Mutiny on the Bounty,” even “The Fugitive Kind,” “Morituri” and “The Night of the Following Day.” The flick runs almost 1 hour, 48 minutes, and was shot on the shores of Hoboken, New Jersey.

It has kind of become the popular thing to kick Titanic, the film and its achievements. It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997. You jump - I jump. Titanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure. Never let go. So may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go.

The first, weaker, element features a young ""Dawson"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who wins a third class ticket to New York on the soon to depart liner. Meantime, the wealthy but unhappy ""Rose"" (Kate Winslet) is up in the posh cabins with her cold and unfeeling fiancée ""Hockley"" (Billy Zane) and her equally unpleasant, venally ambitious mother ""Ruth"" (Frances Fisher). Desperately unhappy, ""Rose"" considers jumping off the prow of the boat, but luckily the charming young ""Dawson"" is on hand to talk her down, and so begins their friendship that causes much chagrin amongst her socially elite companions. That friendship culminates in him making a rather provocative drawing of her, the final straw for her boyfriend and his enforcer ""Lovejoy"" (David Warner). It all looks ominous for both until - part two begins. The ship, speeding along nicely under the command of Bernard Hill\'s Captain Smith clips the underwater part of an iceberg and now history takes over. James Cameron offers us a purely speculative account of what might have happened as the initially incredulous crew start to realise that maybe it is not just Molly Brown (an excellent Kathy Bates) that\'s unsinkable! What now ensues are a series of well staged scenarios depicting panic, fear, a fair degree of selfishness and some proper stiff upper lips as the ship has be evacuated and the segregation of the passengers and competencies of the crew start to become life threatening. The visual effects have dated, the smoke from the ship\'s funnels blows in an strangely symmetrical fashion and the later scenes struggle to convince - but this is really a rather tragic love story with a strong chemistry between the engaging two characters at the top of the bill, and an effective performance from the older ""Rose"" (Gloria Stewart) who takes on the role of narrator 80 years after the disaster. I still find it uncomfortable to watch the actuality of the wreck, which features occasionally throughout the film - I feel like I am quite literally walking through someone\'s grave; but it does lend a potent hook upon which this lengthy, but well thought out and constructed drama is presented. Criticisms have been made of it\'s factual inaccuracies, and it may well play a bit fast and loose with some of the real characterisations - but it\'s a drama, and to be enjoyed has to be appreciated in that sphere.

This movie has it all. A tremendous score, deep emotion emphasized by fantastic performances, and incredibly gripping and high-stakes action. There is really something for everyone here. Before I continue my praise of the film, I think it has one glaring weakness: the present-day plot. For me, this just did not work all that well. I understand that it was implemented for the main story to have a more emotional impact, but it was not needed. It added almost thirty minutes to the runtime, which could have been used for more character development in the story or to have a more streamlined plot. Not to mention, the acting in this section was lackluster. That might be a hot take, but it was something that I noticed during my watch. Back to the positives. The score is magnificent here. The minute I finished the film, I had an urge to put on this score to be transported back to the Titanic. That does not happen very often to me. The performances are great all around. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's chemistry was perfect. They played off each other so well and really sold this emphatic and rapid love the two shared. The movie spends a lot of time building their relationship and the payoff at the end is worth every second. Billy Zane was an over-the-top asshole, and even though it was cheesy at times, it worked for me. The other ancillary cast members did well, including Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher and Bill Paxton. This film is really two movies put into one and both of them work excellently. The first half is a charming and cute love story that spends a lot of time on character development, laying the background for motivations and personalities. While this half may have been my favorite, it is slightly outdone by the second half, which is a gripping and suspenseful survival action story. This section is brutal, showing large scale panic and hysteria while also having some incredibly horrific deaths. The chaos was infectious and very scary to watch. Both halves create a great sense of emotion in the audience and complement each other very well. Overall, this movie had twenty-five years of hype and critical acclaim to live up to, and I am happy to say it passed expectations. Since leaving the theater, I cannot stop thinking about it.

Some might call it overrated, but it’s hard to deny the emotional weight and the sheer craftsmanship that went into making it. Rewatching it reminded me why it’s stood the test of time, it’s a great mix of story, performances, and technical execution. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet deliver standout performances as Jack and Rose. Their chemistry is natural and believable, and it’s what drives the story forward. The drawing scene is iconic for many reasons, both on and off the screen. Interestingly, it wasn’t DiCaprio sketching Rose, it was actually James Cameron himself. Cameron, who’s also an artist, added a personal touch to the scene by creating the famous drawing. Behind the scenes, Winslet knew the scene could be awkward since it involved nudity and was one of their first together, so she flashed DiCaprio to help him relax. Even with that, he was nervous and flubbed his line, saying, “Lie on that bed… uh, couch” instead of just “couch.” The mistake stayed in the film, and it adds a little authenticity to the moment. Visually, Titanic is impressive on every level. The production design is meticulous. From the luxurious first-class interiors to the gritty third-class quarters, every set looks authentic and lived-in. The cinematography captures both the intimacy of Jack and Rose’s relationship and the overwhelming scale of the disaster. The sinking sequence is still one of the most intense and well-executed moments in film. Cameron used a mix of practical effects, real sets, and CGI to recreate the chaos, and it all blends seamlessly. The result is a scene that’s visually stunning and emotionally gripping. The final act ties everything together perfectly. Rose’s memories, paired with James Horner’s haunting score, deliver an emotional gut punch. That last shot is unforgettable and leaves you thinking long after the credits roll. Titanic isn’t just about a historical tragedy or a love story, it’s a film about human connection and the choices we make when everything’s on the line.

After new versions of The Jungle Book, Aladdin, The Lion King, and many others, now comes the time for Mulan. Therefore, I decided to go back in time and relive one of the latest installments of the Disney Renaissance Era. As a kid, even though I was (and I still am) far from being someone impacted by the Chinese culture, I always enjoyed the movie for its story, characters, and of course, its memorable score. However, for some reason, it never became one of those Disney classics I revisit every year. This might very well be only my 5th time watching this film, which for someone born in the 90s like me, feels weirdly short. This is probably the first time I watch Mulan since I was an innocent young teenager, so I was definitely intrigued to see if my overall opinion would change a lot or not. Well, enough of the suspense, I love it! I appreciate it a lot more than when I was a kid, without a single doubt. In fact, if I could only choose one movie to be remade in the live-action format, Mulan would be my ultimate choice, simply due to its epic and cinematic feel. Not trying to take away from the compelling story and incredible characters, but when it comes to live-action, Mulan has everything to deliver a chill-inducing visual spectacle. This film proves how 2D animation can feel so powerful and emotionally overwhelming. As with every movie from the Disney Renaissance Era, the animation looks gorgeous. Dozens of jaw-dropping shots resemble the epic scope of Lord of the Rings. The action sequences are incredibly riveting and innovative, placing the main character in situations where she needs to act smart. Jerry Goldsmith\'s music plays a vital part in the narrative. Not only it develops characters in a meaningful way, but it helps the story move forward with fun and entertaining songs. Once again, the action set pieces are also elevated by this score, which offers a whole other cinematic layer. Technically, Mulan is one of Disney\'s best animated flicks ever. However, as usual, the two pillars of any film are what people end up saving in their hearts and memory: story and characters. With so many writers attached to screenplay credits, I\'m genuinely surprised Mulan has such a well-written, well-structured, emotionally resonating narrative. Packed with culturally significant storylines, it\'s hard not to feel enthralled by Mulan\'s (Ming-Na Wen) arc. A daughter who goes to war by stealing her old father\'s spot, protecting him from certain death, while also trying to honor her family. A woman who wants to be more than just a wife to some man. Fighting against the menacing Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer) and his army, but also against condescending stereotypes and ancient society rules. Ming-Na Wen gives Mulan a powerful voice worth remembering. After more than twenty years, her journey is still an inspiring tale not only to every woman and young girl on the planet, but to everyone who lays eyes on this movie. Captain Li Shang (BD Wong) also has his own arc of trying to prove himself worthy of being called Captain. Against all the odds, he still trains his troops and honors his own father. Ling (Gedde Watanabe), Yao (Harvey Fierstein), and Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo) are hilarious, but also essential to help save China from the enemy. Shan-Yu works perfectly as an intimidating presence, even though his motivations follow the generic villain formula. Now, prepare yourselves because my only issue with the film might be a hot take. I\'m sure that as a kid, I loved Mushu and all of his jokes. He also has a compelling storyline in the same way as other characters. However, watching the film now, I can only hear Eddie Murphy perform a few jokes like a standup routine. When I listen to Mushu, I don\'t think ""oh, that\'s Mushu"". I think ""that\'s Eddie Murphy"". It\'s a remarkably somber, dark movie to match Disney\'s trademark humor, so the tone\'s balance must be perfect for it to work. Mushu might bring the necessary levity with a lighthearted joke here and there, but overall, he\'s the main reason why sometimes the film loses track of when to take things seriously and when to be funny. All in all, Mulan is one of the most culturally significant animated classics that Disney possesses. Even after two decades, its story inspires every single person who sets eyes in this magnificent piece of cinema. Its emotionally compelling narrative is packed with epic action sequences elevated by a memorable score, which also helps develop characters and carry the story forward. The eponymous character\'s arc still resonates with many people today: a journey of proving one\'s self-worth, family, and breaking stereotypes. With a terrific voice cast, almost every character holds a captivating storyline with their own clear motivations. Visually, it has a cinematic feel that no other Disney animated flick owns. Tonally, the balance could be better. The tragic, somber, dark war is present throughout the whole runtime, and while some levity and humor are definitely welcome, some jokes stand out as unnecessary, and Eddie Murphy\'s Mushu is way too silly during certain moments. Having in mind the target audience, one can\'t complain too much. It\'s a little nitpick in an otherwise phenomenal movie, one that I recommend to every reader so that you can all be inspired by it like so many people all around the world.

After taking a week off from the films, now I'm back with this one. It is a British film based on the book of the same name, which is inspired by a real person and his cat. Well, it might be wrong to say 'his cat', because according to this film, I learnt that they have found one another. So nobody belongs to no one, except in human perception its 'his cat' and that's how this story goes. The title reminded me a classic film, but this is nothing like that one. If fact, it is a very suitable title name. How many people do you think gets a chance to represent themselves for the film version, excluding documentaries. Here Bob the cat had got one. He was so perfect. I'm not really a cat person, but when I was small I lived among lots of them and they all are nothing like this Bob. So if I want one, I need exactly like the Bob. The story is about a young man, James, who is a drug addict. Living on the street, singing to get close to enough money to feed. Sometimes frustratingly short to buy a meal, leads back to the needles at the time he tries his best to free from them. Having no friends and family for support, that's how he meets Bob. Bob is a stray cat who snuck into the James house and instantly they had become friends. All Bob wanted was a safe place and an owner to feed him. And for James, to divert attention from his issues. Humans and animals won't talk, but all those great relationships are built with wonderful understanding. I have seen many films based on man and animal bond, and there's nothing new from this, yet very inspiring. This tale was told from James perspective, having Bob alongside, but very nicely revealed how things change when we start to commit to something with a great support. ❝You got yourself a lifelong partner there. Better friends than people, they are.❞ From the outside, it looks like another 'Inside Llewyn Davis'. A man with no future, having a guitar in one hand and a cat in another, roaming the city. Other than that it is totally a different film. Well cast and made a film. The female lead looked like on cosplay. There's a little romance, but the focus always has been James and Bob. Even there are many scenes from Bob's perspective, like through his eyes how things look. Going after a mouse, travelling on the bus and bicycle, performing on the street, the camera literally on the ground to reveal that angle of the story. In a country like India, all domestic animals including pet animals roam casually everywhere without bothering about any threat. But elsewhere, like as in this film in England, one must get a license to have a pet. What I meant is, people are not used to those animals on the street and when they see one, they go like 'oh, so cute', 'so sweet'. Anyway, Bob and James won the many hearts. When they get on the street, it will be a spotlight. Crowd throng to see them, the rare partnership led them to fame. That was not their intention, but it helped them to overcome poverty. The pet lovers would love this film. Despite the original theme is darker with drugs, the film was fun and friendly for almost all ages. Seems like a holiday film, particularly to watch during Christmas. Well, it came on that season, but I saw it only now and I'm happy I did not give it a miss. This is a good film for families, so recommended it to them. Meanwhile, there's a follow-up book and I'm hoping that they would turn it as well a film. I don't know the book, but after watching this one, I feel it is worth it.

It is truly a comic magazine brought to life on the big screen and more focused on delivering a sequence of action scenes and laughs than anything intelligent in the form of plot or characters. I would say it is a movie for the younger audience and comic fans. Having said that I must admit that I found it rather fun to watch. The main characters are two mostly irresponsible rascals, one dumb but likable living tree and two fanatics of which one certainly need not apply to the Mensa club. Of the five I liked Rocket and Gamora the best. Rocket is a rather likable rascal and Gamora is simply cool. Quill is sometimes just silly, Groot is more of a living prop and Drax is just too stupid. The story is more or less just there to tie the scenes together. Unfortunately we do really not get much of a background to the Guardians of The Galaxy universe. It would have been nice to get a bit more understanding of why things are as they are etc. The return of this movie is watching the action, the special effects and the laughs. It is an action-adventure-comedy plain and simple. If you approach it as such it works reasonably well. Speaking of special effects, they are generally well done. The designs are interesting. The shape of the bad guys spaceship is totally ludicrous of course but visually pleasing and goes with the rest of the movie’s tendency to be more of a comedy than a serious movie. The same can be said for that cool but weird net they made by interlinking fighter crafts. On the whole an entertaining movie. I have to say that the dancing scene at the end was a wee bit too silly for me though. I have a problem understanding how a movie like this can get such a relatively high rating at IMDb but okay it was fun to watch and it is not entirely undeserved.

I saw it on the first day of its Australian cinematic release, but I wasn’t sure what I thought. I watched it again and still wasn’t sure, but now that it’s six months later, I am sure. I’m a massive fan of director James Gunn. Come to think of it, I’m also also a big fan of Lee Pace, Michael Rooker, Chris Pratt, Benicio Del Toro, Djimon Honsou, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Peter Serafinowicz, Alexis Denisof, Rob Zombie and Nathan Fillion, and they’re all in this. Not to mention I’m an absolute sucker for the MCU.

I don’t want people thinking I didn’t like it. I did. In fact I will go on record saying that it was miles away from their worst film, and if I’m being honest they handled the last 25 minutes (arguably the most important part) of the film absolutely spectacularly. But I didn’t get the magic that everyone was telling me about. How this was the film for the new generation.  I didn’t even get the sense of satisfaction that I had in Cap’s movie just a few months previous. So many things seemed under utilised, but I don’t know what you could have cut to make room for the extra things I wanted. Which means the only way to get it is to have a longer film. It’s already two hours, and a longer movie means a bigger budget and less screenings. ie. more money going out and less money coming in. And at the end of the day Disney is a business, and they have to make their money the best way they think they can.

He is a travelling strongman who buys ""Gelsomina"" (Giulietta Masina) from her mother for a pretty paltry sum and some food. She\'s none-too-pleased with her new, nomadic, life and he is not exactly the ideal companion. In fact, he\'s a bit of a thug! She\'s no shrinking violet, though, and after some failed attempts at escape, determines that this is her new life and that she is going to make the best of things. Might she even end up enjoying this life? Enter the nimble and agile tight-rope walker rather unkindly referred to as ""The Fool"" (Richard Basehart) whom she befriends, and he starts to open her eyes to another, hitherto unconsidered, possibility about the bullish ""Zampanò"" and the rationale behind his behaviour towards her. Fellini really does know how to let his stars shine here, and the photography - especially of the visually expressive and engaging Masina works really well with this simple but never straightforward drama. She presents us with a portrayal of a woman of character and as the plot thickens, the delivery of her relationship with the very much on-form Quinn becomes quite compelling to watch. Set amidst the debris of post-war Italy it also reminds us of just how society was struggling to get back onto it\'s feet, and to move on - even if the largely rural communities featured here had little, if any, prospects of seeing any improvements. The circus isn\'t a way to riches and comfort - it\'s rudimentary entertainment for a population that needs momentary distraction and it must travel continuously just to keep the proverbial wolf from it\'s door. That relentlessness provides us with the potent vehicle for an interesting character study that contrasts the strength and brutishness of one with the subtlety of the others and it looks great too.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Comedy', 18), ('Other', 113)]}]",100,Yes!

Harry Potter is an Orphan who on his eleventh birthday discovers he\'s a wizard and is called to term at Hogwarts School. But Harry is soon to find out that his past, and his destiny, is a truly remarkable, magical, and terrifying thing. Harry Potter And The Philosopher\'s Stone arrived in a blaze of publicity, one of the most hyped and talked about motion pictures of the decade had finally arrived. The box office was guaranteed to bulge based on fandom book base alone, regardless of if the film got bad word of mouth or not, it was destined to be a monster smash hit. To someone like me who to this day has never read any of the Harry Potter books, it was easy for me to view objectively without comparison to the source - I enjoyed it immensely upon theatre release, and I still enjoy it equally as much now. Director Christopher Columbus, I believe has wisely stayed loyal to the source material, and thus pleased the literature masses. Yet not all newcomers to the party were that taken by the magic on show, that\'s a little baffling to me because the budget explodes from the screen at every turn. Oliver Twist like sets form the marvellous Diagon Alley, dream like smoke cloaks the splendid Hogwarts Express, the school itself is a monolithic delight nestling in among eerie mountains - and what about the exhilarating introduction of Quidditch? Pulsating and frantic with no amount of devilment to keep us intrigued throughout. The characters are all perfectly formed in the first two thirds of the film, here Columbus pulls off a masterstroke by interjecting the character arcs with dashes of wonder so that we the audience never gets bored. The final reel plays out solidly as per the mysterious ""who done it"" core of the piece, but it\'s down to the previous work in the film that we actually care come the finale. Some great casting of the adults really helps to make the film triumph, with Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane (one of the best casting jobs of the decade I would say), Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Zoe Wanamaker all doing excellent work here. The kids are all newcomers that overnight were to become household names, all fresh faced and wet behind the ears, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint & Tom Felton are a delight to watch, and they all help to keep the feeling of charm constantly glowing up on the screen.

Who doesn\'t remember “La La Land”? It was released in theaters in 2016, and was one of the most viewed and acclaimed films of that year. It was a film that was virtually carried in the lap between festivals and awards of the seventh art, and that seemed destined to clean them all up, as “Titanic” had done two decades before. When he arrived at the Oscars, he had practically nominations in almost every category where he could be included! Of the fourteen nominations, however, it collected “only” six statuettes, with the seventh – Best Film – slipping through the fingers in what was the most absolute embarrassment in the entire history of the Hollywood Academy: the infamous but historic exchange of envelopes, that we all have in our memory. But when I said “only”, it is necessary to put things in perspective: what many producers would not have given to win six Oscars in one of their films! Like it or not, it was a great achievement and ""La La Land"" received a well-deserved accolade that night. The film, directed by newcomer Damien Chazelle, is a worthy homage to musicals from Hollywood\'s golden age, and features a generally sympathetic script: an aspiring starlet trying to become an actress meets and falls in love with a purist jazz pianist. who wants to restore people\'s interest in the musical genre he loves, and which he feels is slowly being lost. It is their mutual passion that makes them not give up on their respective dreams, but it will also end up dictating that both follow their own paths. And indeed, the film\'s bittersweet and slightly too realistic ending shockingly clashes with the magic felt throughout the rest of the film. It\'s like having a very beautiful dream, where anything is possible with some effort and serious work, and ending up seeing that dream trampled by a heavy, raw and often unfair reality. And it must be said, although the characters seem likeable, they are selfish and only think about themselves and their interests. They seem to stick together only as long as it really benefits their individual interests. Although I don\'t like the characters very much, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling offer us, in the film, two magnificent works of interpretation and also of singing and dancing. Gosling showed hidden talents on the keyboard of a piano, and both are very good at choreography, although singing is not particularly strong point for either. Both are young, and it is quite possible that they will give us even better dramatic performances in the future. The rest of the film\'s cast hardly matters, it\'s one of those movies where the main characters are so overwhelming and omnipresent that there\'s no room for anyone else. Technically, the film has several frankly good aspects that deserve our attention and our praise. For starters, the film\'s honest and intelligent way of recreating and inserting scenes and dance routines from the great musicals of the past, from “Shall We Dance” to “Singing in the Rain” and “West Side Story”. The scenarios, the elements, the routines are there. The cinematography, colorful, frank, generous with light, is magnificent and a feast for the eyes.

Surely it will be a cult classic. It has lots of great dialogue, and bold revelations in a simple way about the facts of the world. Especially like related to the sex and other grown up stuffs clarifying the little kids' doubts. At some point I thought it was okay for the kids to watch with their parents, but it did not get better on that perspective.

So, unless you kept up with the anime, this film isn’t for you. Just letting you know right off the bat. I would love to be able to describe in words what Dragon Ball means to me, but I can’t. It’s impossible to create a sentence that seamlessly lets you know how nervously excited I was right before the movie started. Yesterday, it was my first time watching my favorite anime on the big screen, and oh my God, it was AWESOME! Finally, I watched a film that I was highly anticipating, and I actually enjoyed it. Finally! I was tired of expecting big things from movies I really wanted to become a huge success, just to get ultimately disappointed. Broly is everything I wished for and more. Nevertheless, I must advise you: this animated flick is NOT for a casual moviegoer! If you stopped following Dragon Ball after Z or you don’t even know what DB is, you’ll basically be lost. You won’t recognize certain characters, you won’t understand how and why some guys are still alive, and you’ll have no clue about how strong our warriors became. This is for the fans. I’ve seen critics bashing this film to shreds, and they start their reviews stating “I’ve never seen the anime.” Then why would you watch a movie that clearly follows the anime’s story and review it? Just leave it alone! It’s like watching Avengers: Endgame without ever watching a single one of the 21 previous installments. It’s just nonsensical. So, with that out of the way, and assuming I’m writing for fans of the anime … This is the best Dragon Ball film ever, by a long shot. Yes, the track record wasn’t that good to begin with, and most of the movies released aren’t even canon. Still, Battle of Gods and Resurrection ‘F’ were pretty great, especially the former. Broly easily surpasses these two, in almost every aspect. Of course, I need to be fair to those first films. Dragon Ball Super elevated the anime once again and brought it back to the mainstream, so obviously, Broly had a lot of advantages since the studios offered everything they could so that the movie would be a major success. When the first two films were released, Super didn’t exist yet. Basically, these first movies were trying to bring back Dragon Ball to life while Broly is all about keeping it alive and showing it still has tremendous potential. Thankfully, it all worked out perfect. The box office results are mind-blowing which will surely guarantee the continuation of Super (I’m waiting every single day for the news of the series renewal), and the film is, in fact, astonishing. The animation quality is absolutely jaw-dropping. You know when you go with friends to watch a movie and something so awesome occurs that you just look at each other in awe of what just happened? That’s Broly every single minute from the moment the fight begins. Super gave the fans a glimpse of what the animation level could be if time was not an issue for the animators. The Tournament of Power arc is undeniable proof that when the production leaves the animators work with no pressure, the end result is outstanding. It’s just so freaking awesome. This is the only word in the dictionary that can reflect how crazily good the animation is. Awesome. There are so many long sequences of choreographed fights, with the animation always on-point, and with exceptional editing. The aspect I love the most is probably how fast it all is. Finally, I can understand Krillin when he says “how are you following that?!” Everything flows in such a flawless style: the characters, the blasts, the environment, everything. The sound design is incredibly powerful, as well. From the get-go, you know you’ll feel every punch, kick, “Kamehameha” and “Galick Gun.” Goku, Vegeta, and Broly provide so many amazing action scenes, and I know I’ll constantly rewatch them once they become available. God, Super ended a year ago, and I still find myself watching the final fight with Jiren every week or so. However, Dragon Ball isn’t about the fights. Yes, everyone loves them, and there are a lot of fans who only care about the actual moment when our heroes fight their enemies. As a hardcore fan of the saga, it’s so much more than that. If characters like Goku and Vegeta, but also Piccolo, Gohan or even Frieza didn’t exist, their battles wouldn’t have the same impact. They mean something because these characters are important to me. I care so much about them because they were beautifully-developed throughout hundreds of episodes. I know that fillers can be a bit boring, but for me, they were just another way of getting to know these characters. Give me twenty minutes of banter between Goku and Vegeta, and I’ll be the happiest man on Earth, right now. I’ll put it this way: if you enjoyed Battle of Gods more than Resurrection ’F’, you will love DBS: Broly as much or more than I do. If it’s the other way around, the first half of this film might leave you a bit disappointed. If you’re one of those fans who only care about the fights, you can leave the first 45 minutes with barely any Goku or Vegeta to me and the other fans who care about the story. I heavily praise Akira Toriyama‘s screenplay. This is the big difference to the other non-canon movies: they weren’t written by someone who really understands the characters at their disposal. Toriyama knows exactly who Broly is, where he comes from, and how he lived through his young years. He wonderfully flushes out Broly by giving him an emotionally captivating backstory, filled with parent abuse, violence, and isolation from the rest of the universe. The history of Saiyans and Planet Vegeta is (finally) told entirely, by showing us characters that we all know and love, but that we were never able to see for more than a few minutes. Nevertheless, the standout character of the film is Broly. He has more screentime than any of the other warriors, precisely due to the reason I mentioned above: for us to care about him. Truth is, when they start fighting, I don’t want anyone to win or lose, because I genuinely care about all of them. Toriyama wasted half of the movie to develop this “new” character, and I 100% support his decision. Not only it generates more build-up to the inevitable climax, but it offers more layers to it. It stopped being “just a fight.” Obviously, there were going to be nods to the past adventures. I almost dropped a tear when Goku and Vegeta show up for the first time due to the soundtrack alone. You’ll love every single “flash” regarding previous moments of Dragon Ball history, including the latest series and arc. Toriyama also does a remarkable job in helping fans that never watched Super trying to understand what happened after Z, even if he didn’t need to. The comedy bits are hilarious, as they have been with the latest series. From Vegeta yelling at Goku for doing or saying something dumb, to Bulma‘s interactions with Beerus and Whis, every joke lands in one way or another. As much as I love this film, it does have some issues regarding its mixing of CGI with animation. One of the things I didn’t like at all in Resurrection ‘F’ was how some sequences felt like a video game. Unfortunately, there are a couple of moments like that in Broly. In order to keep the scenes flow without any cuts, CGI is necessary so the camera can change to another angle, and sometimes there’s this feeling that you seem to be playing one of Dragon Ball games. However, my biggest gripe has to be with the overuse of visual effects. Using VFX to build rich environment and help the battles have more impact, not only doesn’t work well but it’s just not Dragon Ball. As we reach the climax, the VFX overpower the animation, and that is never a good thing. The fight loses its animated essence, and it becomes something that I don’t even know how to describe, except that it isn’t what it was supposed to be. In addition to this, even though I stated that this movie is about Broly and Broly alone, I would have loved to see more from Frieza. He acts purely as a plot device, and there’s barely anything for him to actively do, but he’s still important to make the plot move forward. Finally, the pacing could have been more balanced. Since the ending is predictable from even before the fight begins, it feels that the film was a bit stretched to try to reach the two-hour runtime. Also, if you’ve seen all the trailers, you basically know the entire movie. That’s why I keep advising my followers to stop watching trailers or at least all of them. If you really need visual confirmation that the film deserves your time and money, watch the first trailer and decide from there. Dragon Ball Super always gave spoiler-heavy previews of the next episode, and the movie literally shows everything. Even without watching a single clip from it, I couldn’t escape the spoilers regarding the appearance of specific characters, which pretty much ruined any surprise the film could have offered me. Even with that in mind, I still think the ending felt a bit rushed, contradicting the somewhat slow pace during the first two acts. In the end, there’s no doubt about it. Dragon Ball Super: Broly is, by far, the best Dragon Ball movie to date, and it’s really freaking awesome! It beats any other installment of the franchise, including the latest films. Akira Toriyama working together with a phenomenal team of animators is a match made in heaven. The story is remarkably well-written, with a full half dedicated to introduce and develop Broly as a mentally troubled child who had to deal with so much pain during his life. The animation reaches its peak quality-wise, demonstrating that when time is given to the animators, their work can be a visual masterpiece. With such an intriguing backstory on the history of Saiyans and a brilliantly structured build-up to an epic fight between Broly, Goku, and Vegeta, there was still time to cherish the nostalgia with some nods to previous moments in the beloved saga, as well as some hilarious comedy bits. With more control over the use of CGI and visual effects, this could very well be one of 2019’s best movies. It still can be, but the climactic final battle lost of a bit of its impact due to the overwhelming VFX which completely overcame the animation itself. The ending is predictable before we reach half-runtime, and the spoiler-heavy trailers didn’t help to keep surprise as a factor. I have to repeat what almost every critic has been saying: if you’re a fan of the saga and you kept up with Super, this will give you everything you want and more. If you’re just a casual moviegoer or if you stopped watching after Z, it’s better if you don’t “poison” social media with opinions on a film that simply wasn’t made for you. Thank you, Toriyama! Thank you for giving me the chance to see my favorite anime on the big screen for the first time, and for making it epic.

The mystery of how Rebecca died and what kind of woman she really was is explored, and with the intrusion of scoundrel George Sanders and some well-meaning advice from Maxim\'s toothy sister (Gladys Cooper), the new Mrs. De Winter (her first name is never revealed) finds out more than she bargained for. If you thought Olivier\'s Heathcliff in ""Wuthering Heights"" was dark and somewhat depressing, wait until you meet his more civilized Maxim. Joan Fontaine\'s bride is as far from Merle Oberon\'s ""wild and sweet"" Cathy as you can find, but as far as Gothic tales of brooding men and their lost souls go, the two movies make a perfect double feature. Samuel Goldwyn and David Selznick were Hollywood\'s most famous independent producers, so sometimes their careers are compared. They share many of the same players, and in the case of these two films, the same photographer (Gregg Toland). Fontaine and Olivier work well on screen together, even though they apparently did not share a close working relationship. It is, however, the supporting players who are the shining stars. Anderson\'s Mrs. Danvers is a role we\'ve already seen on screen (usually played by Gale Sondergaard), but being Anderson\'s second film (and first in 7 years), there was a lot of curiosity surrounding her considering her reputation as one of Broadway\'s hottest dramatic actresses. Mrs. Danvers isn\'t a one dimensional evil housekeeper; You understand her affection for the late Rebecca from the very beginning, and in every movement Anderson makes, you cannot take your eyes off of her. I can\'t praise her highly enough. Sanders\' suave villain (who playfully calls Mrs. Danvers ""Danny"") is extremely likable and almost equal in stealing away the attention of the leads. Gladys Cooper and Nigel Bruce add on a delightful ""pip pip"" quality to their eccentric characters, while in her brief time on screen, Florence Bates is hysterically funny, putting out a cigarette in her cold cream, and coolly telling Fontaine how she can never truly be a ""great lady"". Every moment here is a classic movie memory, from the opening narration to Fontaine\'s first vision of De Winter, and then, the rainy ride down to where Fontaine sees Mandalay for the first time. The light first quarter darkens the moment we see Anderson pop into view as Mrs. Danvers. A cold pause, then ""How Do You Do"" reveals the tension, and from there, everything is set. Anderson explodes in two scenes-the first where she finds the hiding Fontaine in Rebecca\'s old room, and later, when Fontaine confronts Anderson after discovering her treachery. The film sags just a bit with the discovery of a body that might be Rebecca\'s, but that is minor. C. Aubrey Smith is memorable in his small role as Maxim\'s attorney. The final shot will live on in your memory, just as Mandalay lived on in the second Mrs. De Winter\'s. While ""Rebecca"" won Best Film at that year\'s Academy Awards, many film historians prefer the message drama ""The Grapes of Wrath"" as the better film. I find the two rank very close, and also quibble over between the choice of Jane Darwell for Supporting Actress over Anderson\'s Mrs. Danvers. A big mistake was not nominating Sanders. A BBC version years later is also very good, a bit more faithful to the novel, and benefits from Diana Rigg as a more approachable Mrs. Danvers and a very diva-ish performance by Faye Dunaway in the Florence Bates role.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Comedy', 2), ('Drama', 2), ('Romance', 2), ('Crime', 2), ('Other', 4)]}, {'writer': 'John Chard', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'Do you think the dead come back and watch the living? Rebecca is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and adapted to screen play from the Daphne du Maurier novel of the same name. It stars Laurence Olvier, Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson. Cinematography is by George Barnes and music scored by Franz Waxman. After meeting and marrying \'Maxim\' de Winter (Olivier), the Second Mrs. de Winter (Fontaine), finds life at his English estate, Manderley, far from comfortable because the servants and the house serve to remind her of the first Mrs. de Winter, whose death remains a source of mystery. What did happen to the first lady of the house? Can this newly married couple survive the oppressive cloud that looms large over the mansion? A Gothic emotional near masterpiece, Alfred Hitchcock\'s first American film may seem a bit too serviceable at times, something he was also aware of himself, but the production values are high and the story is played out supremely well. Within the story we can find Hitchcock\'s now famous trait of mistrusting Women, but in the main it stays the tragic tale of one young woman living in the ominous shadow of the previous Mrs. De Winter. Mood is often set as foreboding, with the director understanding the psychological pangs of the source material once the action switches to the de Winter home of Manderley. It arguably is a touch too long, and the restraint of Hitchcock, down to producer David O. Selznick overseeing things, stops it being a bit more unnerving than it should be. For Manderley the mansion here is one of the finest put on the screen, this is because Hitchcock and brilliant cinematographer George Barnes manage to make it bold & beautiful one minute, and then the next scene it comes off as a monolithic nightmare. It\'s wonderful case of the surroundings playing the extra character for maximum effect. Laurence Olivier is impressive, even if we would learn later on that this is the sort of performance he could do in his sleep. The supporting cast do great work as well, especially as regards the cold and terrifying turn from Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers. However, to me this will always be Joan Fontaine\'s show, she nails it perfectly, the new Mrs. De Winter wants to do right but can\'t seem to so for doing wrong, she infuriates at times, yet the next minute you just want to hold her, for she\'s so vulnerable, but beautifully so, it\'s a brilliant performance in a brilliant film. The ending is a switheroo from the novel, and it almost derails the success the film has achieved up to that point. And looking at it now it\'s hard not to curse the Production Code for enforcing a big change to what was revealed in du Maurier\'s wonderful novel. But the film has survived the ""appeasing"" ending to stand the test of time for all the ages. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Barnes also won for Best Black & White Cinematography, it was nominated for a further nine awards, including Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. No nomination for Waxman, sadly, but his score is worthy of a mention for the evocative strains that sit nicely with the tone of the story.

Alfred Hitchcock was truly a master, and there are not many directors who can present a CV so vast, so rich and so deserving of acclaim. Ironically, he did not win a single Oscar for his work as a director and even this film, which was one of the most awarded in his work, only won two Oscars (Best Film and Best Black-and-White Cinematography) at the 1941 ceremony. The film was produced by David O. Selznick through his own studio, which was then busy completing and releasing “Gone With the Wind”. He had acquired the film rights to the original novel, by Daphne du Maurier, and hoped that Hitchcock would be faithful to the material. He reluctantly agreed, but imposed his deeply detailed working methods, significantly delaying filming, which was just one of the points of friction between producer and director. Things got to the point where Hitchcock banned Selznick from “his” studio and prevented his interference, filming only what he thought he was going to use in order to restrict the final cut. It goes without saying, I believe, that Hitchcock gave us another memorable work worthy of every cinephile's bookshelf. The cinematography, in black and white, is modeled with great care and beauty, using some very innovative techniques for the time. The soundtrack also works wonderfully and is very atmospheric. The mansion's sets and costumes were also points in which the production invested a lot and applied itself, in order to provide greater realism. It appears that the exterior of the house was, in fact, a scale model. The script is impressively effective: after a quick courtship, a very rich man marries a young woman from modest origins and takes her to his impressive mansion. However, he was a recent widower, and the house is filled with disturbing memories of his previous marriage, as if his first wife still roams around, and could become a palpable presence that threatens to tear the couple apart. There are more elements in between, such as the housekeeper's strange obsession with her previous boss, to whom she devoted a bizarre loyalty, and the deepening of the mysteries leads to a surprising ending, so it's worth not reading anything about the film before watching see it in its entirety. Of course, if we think about it, it becomes incomprehensible that, with a new wife, that man kept the housekeeper in his house, along with all the objects that belonged to the deceased... Joan Fontaine was chosen for the main character, giving us a quality, very convincing performance. She seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown for a huge period of time and that is what certainly earned her the Oscar for Best Actress for this work, one of the best in her career. Laurence Olivier also does a good job and, despite hating Fontaine's choice (he pressured the production to give the role to his real-life partner, Vivien Leigh) and not having a good, friendly relationship with her colleague, he is extraordinarily competent when they are on stage together.

But one can't help missing the sparks that was once between them - and Luke of course, hmm...

From genre and synopsis to cast, directors, and screenwriters, sometimes just a familiar name can convince me to give that movie a go. Producers and/or executives are far from being remotely influential in this type of decision. However, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have directed/written/produced some of my favorite animated films of the last decade (The LEGO Movies, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse), so obviously, I needed to watch The Mitchells vs. The Machines, previously known as Connected. Mike Rianda has his debut as a director, screenwriter, and voice actor (Aaron Mitchell, son), accompanied by Jeff Rowe, the other writer. 2021 is shaping up to be a phenomenal year. It truly is. I absolutely loved Soul and Wolfwalkers, but if this Sony Pictures Animation flick came out last year, I genuinely don't know which one would I put higher on my Top10. Rianda and Rowe deliver a brilliantly original screenplay, packed with incredibly relatable characters and beautifully handled themes. I can't quite remember the last time I laughed out loud when watching an animated feature by myself. Every joke about technology is hilariously clever, making fun of ridiculous yet realistic human behaviors regarding malfunctions, low speed, and even lack of Wi-Fi. I cried of laughter, but I was also close to dropping a couple of tears due to the main narrative. I'll start with the protagonist, Katie Mitchell. As a young, aspiring filmmaker, Abbi Jacobson's character follows a well-known arc about not having friends, being the so-called weirdo, and having parents - in this case, more her father - who simply don't understand who she is, what she likes, or why she loves something they simply don't understand. While it's true that this storyline isn't exactly new, it doesn't mean it's not captivating and emotionally powerful when written and developed properly. Rianda and Rowe make Katie an extremely relatable character in such a seamless manner that it's harder to not connect with her than the contrary. Anyone has at least once in their lifetime felt left out or alone. Obviously, since I share the exact same passion as Katie, it's easier for me to feel precisely the same as her once she discovers new friends with whom she can talk about the art she loves the most. I still have no circle of friends who I can meet daily to discuss the latest movie news or newly released films (in-person), so Katie's journey does have a more significant impact on me than it might have on other viewers. However, it doesn't have to be about art or a specific subject. In a general analysis, Katie just feels lonely and wants to follow her dreams, but feels unsupported by her father, Rick Mitchell (Danny McBride). One of the most compelling aspects of The Mitchells vs. The Machines is the fact that Rick and Katie share the same arc, just going in different directions. While Katie feels like getting out of the house and going away forever is the best solution to all her problems, Rick believes that her staying with the family is the safest route, one that features no failures that could hurt her emotionally - something that Rick learned from his past, hence the necessity of overprotecting her daughter at all costs. Since they're on opposite sides of the spectrum, constant fights, lies, and hurtful comments drive them apart, leading to a wonderfully written story about family, love, friendship, and understanding the other side of the argument. Katie's mother, Linda Mitchell (Maya Rudolph), and brother, Aaron Mitchell (Rianda), serve more as triggers to heartfelt conversations with the two main characters, but they also have their own personal journey. While Linda feels jealous of her Instagram-perfect neighbors and embarrassed of showing off her own family photos, Aaron deals with his bizarre love for dinosaurs in a lighter, funnier way than Katie's dramatic arc. Both storylines carry their own lovely messages to transmit to the audience, but Katie and Rick's confrontational relationship embodies sensitive issues that tons of families across the globe never find a solution for. Another remarkable characteristic of this screenplay is how Rianda and Rowe never take a definite stance on any topic. They always try to follow one of the movie's main messages and present good points for both sides of the conflict. For example, The Mitchells vs. The Machines could easily be misinterpreted as an attack on the Internet and technology in general, but every dialogue is exceptionally balanced. While comments are made about using our phone at the dinner table or during family moments, as well as excessive screentime and overreliance on social media, new technology can give birth to the most inspirational, motivational, and influential works of art. Without it, Katie's dreams would be totally different. Transitioning to the more technical elements of the film, it's impossible not to tackle the new animation style. Into the Spider-Verse was an experimental movie, and its success might have changed the future of animation forever. The mix of a more illustrative, hand-painted approach with another focused on the CGI realism seen in most films today offers - just like the movie itself - a seamless balance between the two supposedly opposing styles. This blend allows keeping the expressiveness and extreme level of detail of the classic method while also maintaining the realistic environment of the 3D/CGI design. The action sequences are extraordinarily energetic, riveting, and quite impressive, to say the least. The film's soundtrack (score by Mark Mothersbaugh) is on-point, elevating dozens of scenes with excellent music choices that most viewers didn't even remember already. Exquisite editing (Greg Levitan) and outstanding voice work across the board. I genuinely can't find a single issue with this movie, and I'd be extremely surprised - and disappointed - if it doesn't end up being a frontrunner for next year's awards season. Both kids and adults will have tremendous fun with this fast-paced, highly entertaining film while also getting a few valuable life lessons along the way. And who knows? Maybe this movie will inspire families to make that road trip they've been planning for ages… The Mitchells vs. The Machines might not have the catchiest title, but it's definitely one of the best animated feature films of the last years. With a beautiful blend of two animation styles - that may impact the future of this type of movie - Mike Rianda and Jeff Rowe deliver an emotionally resonant story about family, love, and more explicitly, placing ourselves in someone else's shoes. Featuring incredibly relatable characters, the remarkably written screenplay strikes a perfect balance in every topic it approaches by presenting arguments for both sides without ever defining something as right or wrong. The character arcs might be well-known storylines, but the exceptional writing elevates every personal journey, especially Katie and Rick's, daughter and father. Boasting great voice work from everyone involved, the fast-paced narrative still holds impressive, colorful, screen-popping action sequences filled with energy, excitement, and fantastic song choices. It's one of those uncommon films where I can't find a single flaw with it. A must-watch,hilariousfilm for both kids and adults.

The last David Fincher\'s film I\'ll be able to review before Mank, his next masterpiece… I hope. I\'ve been through Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac, The Social Network, and now it\'s time for Fincher\'s latest installment, Gone Girl. Clearly, Fincher loves to work with people he knows. Jeff Cronenweth has been his director of photography in half of his movies, same for Kirk Baxter as part of the editing team, and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross in the musical score. Even his production designer, Donald Graham Burt, has been around since Zodiac. However, Fincher always works with a different writer, and this time, he partners up with a debutant screenwriter, Gillian Flynn, author of the original novel that originates this adaptation. Usually, when it comes to writers, I take this change of media with a grain of salt since writing a book isn\'t exactly the same as writing a screenplay (it\'s completely different, I was being generous). With that said, Flynn absolutely destroys my self-doubts, delivering one of the best scripts of 2014. From the exceptionally captivating, perplexing disappearance of Amy to the underlying theme about how press and media treat this type of news, Flynn\'s screenplay is impressively able to develop each and every narrative in the most perfect way possible. With a remarkable use of time/date stamps, the viewer follows in a detailed manner the events that build up to the tragic day through different perspectives, mainly Amy\'s and Nick\'s. This story\'s greatest accomplishment is how it makes the press influence what the viewer thinks about the characters, just like in real life. Nowadays, people don\'t even click to read the full article and understand its context. A single headline, as far from the truth as it might be, is enough to start a worldwide online debate. The same goes for television networks, and their news shows: if it\'s on the national news program, then it must be true, people think. I may be wrong when I wrote the whole ""change of media"" matter before, but of this, I\'m sure: take every news article you read with a grain of salt because most of the time, the full, true story isn\'t entirely revealed. This takes me to Ben Affleck (Justice League, The Way Back) and what I consider one of the best casting choices of the respective decade. In case you don\'t know, Affleck has been pursued throughout his whole life by journalists who try their hardest to expose his personal life, no matter how disrespectful it may turn out to be. Nick goes through the exact same obstacle. There\'s non-stop news about Amy, and it only becomes a matter of time until Nick starts being accused of being a terrible husband, and ultimately the obvious killer, even though the press can\'t find a single proof. Affleck doesn\'t even need to incorporate a new character since he has the necessary life experience to offer an utterly brilliant performance. Definitely, one of my favorite actors working today. Since I\'m in the realm of performances, I might as well continue with Rosamund Pike (Radioactive). Her interpretation of Amy is almost the opposite of Affleck\'s, in the sense that the latter gives a seemingly simple yet powerful display, while Pike has a much more complex, layered role. She can be menacing and scary but also loving and kind. The puzzle surrounding her disappearance is mostly based on a perspective enigma, as the viewer is told the same story through different lenses throughout the first half of the film. Honestly, this is probably a career-best performance for Pike, who portrays a character of extremes, allowing her to demonstrate her jaw-dropping emotional range. Carrie Coon (Margo Dunne) is another actress I\'ve grown to deeply enjoy watching, and she\'s terrific as Nick\'s sister. Her chemistry with Affleck is spot-on, and I sincerely hope that one day she becomes one of the most coveted actresses in Hollywood. Tyler Perry (Tanner Bolt) is also pretty great as Nick\'s lawyer, but Kim Dickens is even greater as Detective Rhonda Boney, who partially plays the same role as the viewer by trusting that what she sees and hears is undoubtedly the ultimate truth. Flynn\'s screenplay is packed with twists and turns, some of them more surprising than others, but the third act saves an unexpected, shocking turn of events, leading to a powerful ending that will leave most audiences speechless, myself included. Two minor issues. One of them, you probably have already figured it out since I left Neil Patrick Harris (Desi Collings) out of the cast compliments above. Harris is fine as the character he portrays, but I can\'t help but feel that he wasn\'t the right actor for the role. This is a classic Fincher movie: dark, somber, depressing, tragic, and with its own share of violence and blood. In fact, it possesses one of the most disgusting, disturbing uses of blood in a single scene I\'ve ever seen. Harris is an excellent actor, but he stands out from the rest of the cast, and not in a positive way. Again, fine performance, just not the right role for him. The other problem is admittedly an irrelevant nitpick regarding a few details story-wise that stretch the believability of everything just a bit. Nevertheless, this is still a phenomenal film, and it\'s another evidence of David Fincher\'s masterful visual filmmaking. Once again, Fincher works with his known crew members to create a sumptuous look and feel. With seamless editing, a memorable score, and fantastic camera work, Gone Girl is technically magnificent, but it\'s Gillian Flynn\'s debut screenplay that steals the spotlight. Boasting jaw-dropping twists, including an utterly shocking third act and respective ending, Flynn\'s narrative is incredibly engaging due to its remarkable structure and puzzling mystery, never losing an inch of excitement or interest. Ben Affleck is one of the best casting choices of the decade by interpreting a man whose life is deeply affected by the press and media, which should never be fully trusted (a clear and powerful message to the audience), while Rosamund Pike delivers her career-best performance with an emotionally devastating display. Despite the misstep of casting Neil Patrick Harris in such a dark movie and a couple of nitpicks regarding the investigation, everything and everyone else turn this into one of the best films of the 2010s.

This is one of those films that can unnerve and exasperate us, but that we love to watch. In fact, I don't remember seeing many films where the main character deserved my hatred. I don't want to, and I won't reveal what happens in this film, but it's one of those where appearances can be deceiving and where things aren't what they seem. The action focuses on the disappearance of a woman and her husband's efforts to find her. To our eyes, it's obvious that he really wants to find her, perhaps more than her parents, who seem to be just taking the opportunity to publicize the children's books they've published. However, little by little, he becomes a suspect in a hypothetical murder case. David Fincher is a director who has already shown what he's worth: I loved “Se7en”, “Game”, “Fight Club” and “Zodiac”, but I didn't really like “Social Network”, or “Benjamin Button”. In this film, he directs skillfully, but not without debatable choices: for me, the story's most important twist all comes too soon, and the ending is lazy, overly sudden, and makes it feel like the film was cut short before the end. The rest is incredibly well done and works wonderfully, and the film is a gradual construction where the details are fundamental and very well-thought-out. I really liked Ben Affleck's work. For me, it is one of the best films the actor has made to date. We feel his commitment, the way he develops the character and allows himself to appear increasingly distressed, submissive, without a will of his own, like someone who is living a nightmare and just wants it all to end. Alongside this renowned actor is Rosamund Pike, an authentic ice maiden accustomed to the most frigid roles we can imagine. She is not one of my favorite actresses, she is one of those that I consider not very versatile, but she gave everything that her character asked for: coldness, an intelligent and sharp mind, extreme physical and emotional self-control, a calculating spirit and a sweet and angelic face. Among the supporting cast, we have well-selected names, such as the friendly Tyler Perry, a very focused and rational Carrie Coon and a sinister Neil Patrick Harris. Technically, I believe it is fair to highlight the intelligent use of cinematography, which is almost never warm and pleasant. There are scenes where we see this, right at the beginning, where things were going well for Affleck's character, but the essence of the film is made with a cold, uncomfortable color palette and scarce, hazy or artificial light. The film never makes us comfortable and creates its dramatic tension solidly. The sets and costumes also contribute, with that huge house for just one couple, with few signs of human warmth and joy.

Putting aside for a moment the serious subtext of the story, Nimona is a first-class super-hero, and with very real, very human emotions. On top of all that, she is a first-rate comedian too. ""Arm chopping is not a love language."" (Nimona read Chapman\'s book!) If I heard she was going to be at the Improv, I\'d be looking for tickets! Chloë Grace Moretz hit this character right over the outfield wall. The script, the animation, and Chloë combine to make Nimona completely magnetic. Empathize with a character? I was totally in love. Riz Ahmed, the other lead voice, leveled right up to Chloë\'s energy. He played the double-minority cross he bore, with reality and complexity. Those two under-dogs make the best ever super-heroes. The story about the production is that Disney dropped Blue Sky for ""balance sheet reasons"", with the film already 70% finished. I have serious doubts that Disney would ever let this film go untouched. Kudos to Annapurna and Netflix for picking this up. Which brings us to the serious subtext. The script here is amazing. ""It\'s complicated."" The early, and obvious, tip-off that the script is ""inclusive"", and actually about the LGBTQ+ crowd, is the gay relationship of Ballister Braveheart and Ambrosius Goldenloin. What hilarious names for these two characters. Ambrosius from the Greek meaning food of the gods. Ballister, also from Greek, meaning a type of weapon that throws something, a catapult or a crossbow. It\'s truly not unreasonable to have a gay character in this story. Statistically speaking, even if you used a low 3% percentage of the population is gay (although it\'s more like 5-8%), then the odds of having at least one gay in a graduating class of 30 men is much better than an even money bet (60% probability to be exact). As a matter of fact even money says it\'s more likely to have 8-9 gays in a class of 30. I\'m not kidding, or even, as Mark Twain, put it, a damn liar. Two gay knights in the same class actually kissing then, is realistic and honest, given the statistics. No reason to raise a banner announcing it (Disney would have). It\'s only marginally relevant to the plot. Now, I wouldn\'t presume to tell ND Stevenson, the author of the manga, what he meant. Yet, I see this girl, ""What are you?"" ""I am Nimona."", who can only say she is herself. She didn\'t say girl. She is a shapeshifter. A shapeshifter? a girl who is different? Who sees herself as different? A girl who maybe doesn\'t identify quite exactly as other girls? I see Nimona as the T in LBGTQ+. She is the symbolic ""transgender"" of the film that has a macho Todd, a gay Ambrosia, and an evil, intolerant Director who believes her view is the only valid one. If the MAGA hat fits, I say she wears it. At some point, even Ballister who is also ""different"", but maybe not so much as Nimona, struggles to not call her a ""monster"". That is really the next level of meaning in the film: The people that want to ""drive a sword into the heart of anything different."" This peer pressure from the xenophobic crowd tempts even Ballister who, in his (brave)heart, knows it\'s wrong. Ultimately, it\'s Nimona who exposes the subtext by telling us about her very real depression induced by society not accepting her as she is. Throughout life, she was constantly isolated, threatened and rejected for being Nimona - for being the shape-shifting (gender-shifting) she identifies as. Ballister asks her ""What if you held it in? If you didn\'t shape-shift?"" ""I\'d die."" is her serious answer. If a person identifies as something different than her appearance, how can they deny that and live? Depression is the real ""monster"" of the story. In this case, depression literally becomes the demon shape of Nimona. The demon can attack outward, and also inward. This is a truth of depression. A brilliant therapist once told me that depression is anger turned inward. Anger turned inward, becoming depression, can have serious consequences. Do I need mention Robin Williams, Marilyn Monroe, Kurt Cobain, Sylvia Plath, Hunter Thompson, Vincent Van Gogh, and probably someone you know personally? Even Nimona recognizes this. ""I don\'t know what\'s scarier. The fact that everyone in this kingdom wants to run a sword through my heart... or that sometimes, I just wanna let \'em."" Many artists, in every field, also feel this depression of not being accepted. Of being different somehow. Of being ridiculed and not understood. Of being alone in a world that doesn\'t see them as they really are. Nimona is able to turn that anger outward as a mischievous punk. For a while, anyway. Depression is a serious disease. I was brilliantly blind-sided to see this subject treated by this film. I suspect everyone in the LGBTQ spectrum suffers this to some degree. I\'m so amazed and thankful that ND Stevenson, Annapurna and Netflix brought this subject forward at the same time that Republicans are banning gender-affirming care in red states. Regardless of the underlying cause, depression can be helped by therapy, tolerance, acceptance, and, as Ballister showed us, love.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 83), ('Comedy', 27), ('Romance', 25), ('History', 14), ('Other', 73)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'The Queen has broken with tradition and elevated a commoner - ""Boldheart"" to knighthood.

As a young child, Trudy Ederle contracts measles. The doctor thinks that nothing can be done, but she has no intention of throwing in the towel yet and decides she\'d rather have some cheese than a coffin! This illness is taking place against news of a maritime tragedy that saw many women killed. They were afraid to leave the burning ferry boat because they couldn\'t swim. Trudy wants to learn to swim, her mother wants her to learn to swim - but her father, an immigrant German butcher, is much more conformist. It\'s not right for women to swim! Now we get our first indication of the strength of mind of the women in this family as, sure enough, mother (Jeanette Hain) finds her and sister ""Meg"" (Tilda Cobham-Hervey) a women only swimming club run by ""Lottie"" (Sian Clifford) and next, after some seriously punishing training sessions, she (now Daisy Ridley) has her heart set on the Paris Olympiad. History takes over her story now as we follow this hugely inspirational person who sets out to prove that her sex need be no barrier to her abilities and that with the right support around her, she can accomplish just about anything. A combination of Ridley\'s enthusiastic and exhausting performance and a strong slew of supporting actors make this a genuinely quite poignant piece of cinema. Not only does it address issues of sexual repression, but also of racial and cultural attitudes that needed looking at from both within and without. Stephen Graham turns out well as the savvy coach Burgess and Kim Bidnia also strikes a fine balance between caring, fearing and inspiring as her father Henry. I am not really a fan of Christopher Eccleston, and his overly hammy depiction of Scotsman Jabez Wolffe didn\'t quite work for me, but this story is built well from the sand up by Joachim Rønning allowing us to feel some of the emotions running through the veins of this groundbreaking athlete and understand just quite why the public at the time cared, too.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Romance', 18), ('Other', 113)]}, {'writer': 'Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots', 'score': '60%', 'review': 'The extraordinary yet little known true story of Trudy Ederle, the first woman to successfully swim the English Channel, is brought to life in “Young Woman and the Sea,” from director Joachim Rønning. Ederle’s story is one that deserves to be told, and although it’s admittedly not the most interesting, it certainly is inspiring. The film is streaming exclusively on Disney+ just in time for the kickoff of the 2024 Summer Olympics. Starring Daisy Ridley as Trudy, the movie tells the story of a young girl who overcame adversity after a near-death experience when she had a case of the measles in 1914. Told she could never go in the water or she would go deaf, Trudy became more determined than ever to realize her dream of being an accomplished swimmer. Being told she couldn’t do it didn’t defeat her spirit, of course, because that’s what this movie is about – dreamers. Despite pushback from a patriarchal society at nearly ever turn and a choir of those telling her she would never find success, Trudy was selected as a member of the Olympic swimming team in 1924 (and won the gold medal). Soon after, her competitive spirit led her to attempt crossing the 21 mile English Channel by swimming from France to England. It’s a rousing story of a woman born to German immigrant parents in New York City who overcame seemingly insurmountable challenges while pursuing her dream. As you’d expect, the film’s themes of dreaming big, the rewards of perseverance and dedication, and the joy of laughing in the face of those who tell you “no” are not subtle. The story is filled with positive messaging that’s geared towards young girls in particular, celebrating themes of resilience and empowerment. It’s the kind of film that aligns perfectly with the spirit of the Olympics, offering a patriotic and uplifting story that screams “yay, America!” and “Hooray for Girls!” The film starts slow and is a bit depressing, but the story eventually takes off. The scenes of Trudy swimming the Channel are repetitive, however, and feel a lot like it’s a copycat version of last year’s “NYAD.” Still, “Young Woman and the Sea” is a solid story of a remarkable woman and her equally impressive accomplishments. It’s a family-friendly and inspirational biopic of a woman who can serve as a wonderful role model for everyone.

After an opening scene showing simpleton postman János demonstrating to a bar full of drunks how the Earth and moon rotate around the sun with the help of three of the old geezers, he does his rounds in the early morning. Posters put up advertise the arrival of a giant whale with special guest, the Prince. This traveling circus, however, fills the townspeople not with eager anticipation but with dread. Indeed, when the Prince does appear, all hell breaks loose. Based on the novel The Melancholy of Resistance by László Krasznahorkai, the plot of this film is a transparent allegory for Hungary in the 1930s and 1940s: unable to keep its house in order, and falling for the demagoguery of fascism, Hungary brought on itself its long nightmare of Soviet domination. Tarr has curiously stated, however, that he is not offering us a historical allegory. By that I can only imagine that he is turning the allegory into a parable, using a reference to mid 20th-century Hungary as way of exploring more universal themes. Perhaps the central tension in the film is between a natural order, the ecstatic cooperation of free human beings, and an order dictated by a manipulative leader. I don\'t want to spoil anything that happens here, but Tarr\'s depiction of a mob let loose is harrowing. I was very moved by this film the first time I saw it, and on repeat viewings there has been much to appreciate. I feel, however, that the film is greatly weakened by Tarr\'s decision to use German actors for two main roles. Lars Rudolph, who plays János, and Fassbinder mainstay Hanna Schygulla as the sinister ""auntie Tünde"" give physically commanding performances, but they were presumably speaking in German while acting, and Tarr has had them clumsily dubbed into Hungarian, no synchronization between their mouths and the voices.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 78), ('Comedy', 27), ('Romance', 22), ('Documentary', 13), ('Other', 53)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'With the temperature well below zero, it\'s odd to see the rural population of the Hungarian plain standing around awaiting the ultimate in circus attractions (if not the ultimate nightmare for the taxidermist). A giant whale is revealed and, well, many of them have no idea what to make of it. As it remains, it attracts visitors from all around and their arrival starts to cause friction amidst this small community. That\'s especially problematic for the gentle young ""János"" (Lars Rudolph) who is used to being the sole source of local entertainment with his performances in the local boozer. What\'s not really clear to anyone, though, is just why this long deceased leviathan is causing so much trouble. His aunt ""Tünde"" (Hanna Schygulla) tries to recruit his sceptical uncle ""György"" (Peter Fitz) to chair a committee to try to restore some sort of equilibrium, but even that doesn\'t seem destined to calm things down as a mob descend on an hospital where only the epitome of pathetic imagery might just bring them to their senses? Perhaps not for long? It\'s cleary rich in allegory, this, and I\'m guessing the principal point is to suggest that by sewing the seeds of discontent, the Soviets created the perfect scenario for them to ride to the rescue after the war. Maybe a little unfair on the whale, but it seems destined to carry the can for this provocative drama that sees rational behaviour disappear and traditional and family loyalties heavily, and sometimes violently, compromised. The monochrome photography and the penetratingly haunting score add a great deal of richness to this story, and with a really quite emotionally charged, but understated, effort from Rudolph underpinning the complex plot, this makes for an intriguing drama that won\'t make you feel good, but might make you think a little.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Romance', 18), ('Other', 113)]}]",100,Yes!

The local population are poorly educated and hopelessly outgunned but have the advantage of mobility and surprise as they seek to emulate their Oriental contemporaries.

It has the feel of a docu-drama to it, with the characterisations of ""La Ponte"" (Brahim Hadjadj) and ""Col.

A religious maniac marries an idiotic widow and mother of two children in the hope of finding out where the $10,000 is hidden that the now executed husband and father garnered from a robbery. Upon release back in 1955, the critics of the time kicked this first directorial effort from Charles Laughton to such a degree he never directed again. Watching the film now and observing the tide of praise for it as each year goes by, one can only hope that those critics were rounded up and sent to a faraway island to learn about how to view with open heart. The Night Of The Hunter is to me quite simply one of the greatest films ever laid down on the screen. Firstly you have to ask yourself exactly what genre the film belongs to? That alone should lead you to find out that the film is something different, even unique, because it covers so many bases. Perhaps that is what the critics back then couldn't quite fathom? Is it Crime? Is it a Thriller? Horror, Drama, Noir, even a terrifying mother goose fairytale (that last one was Laughton's terming of his masterpiece), truth is, is that it's a multitude of earthly traits masquerading as a good versus evil parable. The work on the film is as good as it gets, the direction from Laughton is sublime, his visual style alone makes the film a feast for the sharp eye connoisseur. Observe some of the cutaway sets, take in the expressionist use of shadows, an underwater sequence that is gorgeous yet terrifying at the same time. I dare you to stop the hairs on your neck standing up on end as the silhouette of Mitchum's evil preacher Harry Powell looms large over the children at bedtime. The film is full of striking images that in themselves are telling the story, witness the pursuit of the children by Powell, the children's river journey is all dreamy and calm, rabbits, frogs and spiders all are prominent to give the feeling that the kids are safe, cut to Powell all in black, cloaked in evil, always one step away from his prey, perhaps a devil in priests attire? The acting is top draw, Mitchum (in a career making role) plays it perfect, evil personified mixed with gentle panto fusion at just the right times. Lilian Gish, in what surely has to be one of the great feminine roles of all time, is precious, quite simply precious, while the children are a believable delight because Laughton has got us viewing this uncertain world through such untainted eyes. Crowning it off is the cinematography from Stanley Cortez, I can only describe it as bleakly beautiful, it impacts on the eyes as much as the head as this truly majestic piece of work unfolds. If you don't see this as a masterpiece then I urge you to watch it every year until you do.

What is special about this film? Really, little. The story is very simple: it is the almost adolescent escape of a young princess who, tired of the responsibilities and visibility inherent in a crown, decides to distract herself and live her youth for a few hours. The problem is that she ends up, inadvertently, at the home of an American news journalist in charge of interviewing her, and who wants to take advantage of the situation. Of course, anyone hoping for an interesting dalliance between the princess and the commoner will be rewarded, to some extent. Predictable? Cliché? Of course, but it was with illusions like these that cinema fed the magic of the monarchical universe, somewhat to its own advantage. If the story told is not particularly brilliant and stands out for its simplicity and a range of obvious choices and solutions, what are we left with? Scenarios? Costumes? Effects? Sound? Cinematography? In part, yes. The sets are very well done, and the film, which is actually filmed in Rome, is one of the first and best cinema postcards of this city. I still know people who have been to Rome, and been where the characters in the film have been too, such as the Trevi Fountain or the Mouth of the Truth, tourist landmarks that this film helped to popularize. Without major effects, it has a nice and atmospheric sound and soundtrack, and the cinematography, in black and white, is very good. The scenes of the two main characters riding a Vespa through the streets of the city center are particularly anthological. We can also say that the film was wonderfully edited, and the story moves at an elegant and pleasant pace. But what would this movie be without Audrey Hepburn? I don't think it's possible to imagine the character in the skin of another actress. She had the nobility and dignified serenity required of royalty, and imbued the character with authenticity, credibility, and friendliness. It's impossible to watch the film and not feel a certain sympathetic affection for her character, who simply wants a few hours to distract herself from the institutional routines and duties for which she was educated.

Without a defined script, without any actor, without a spoken word (the title is sung in a threatening Gregorian tone at the beginning and at the end, but I consider this part of the soundtrack pure and simple), we just see all the images and the sound of the music. In short, the film seems like a mute critique of the modern way of life, in contrast to what was lived in the past, before industrialization. It's what I think. And a good movie?

It served as the basis for ""Twelve Monkeys,"" and, I theorize, may have kick started the central idea in ""The Time Traveler\'s Wife."" Translated as ""The Pier,"" the film opens on a Parisian airport pier, where people can watch planes take off and land. The film has no dialogue aside from the narrator and some hushed whispering, so we are told that the unnamed Man (Davos Hanich) remembers being at the airport as a child before World War III, and watching a man fall and die. The image stayed with him forever, as did the face of a mysterious woman who was also there. Paris has been obliterated in a nuclear holocaust, and the survivors have retreated underground. The Man has been taken prisoner by the war\'s victors -we never learn who ""won""- and is subjected to experimentation by a Doctor (Jacques Ledoux). Other prisoners have died or were turned into vegetables by the experiments, but the Man might be different because he has strong mental images, like the airport, to fall back on. What the Doctor wants to do is send the Man either back into time, or ahead into the future, to get help for the present. The Man is injected with drugs, has a wired blindfold placed over his eyes, and begins time travelling, albeit very slowly. After a week and a half, he does see images like his central image of the airport. Then, after almost a month, he meets an unnamed Woman (Helene Chatelain). The Man is somewhere in the past, and keeps popping in on the same woman. They tour gardens together, and finally the Man explains why he is there, as the Woman listens patiently. What worries the Man most is that he does not know if he is popping in and out of the past, dreaming the Woman up, or remembering that he really did meet her, and only now thinks of her. The ending is sudden, and memorable. I forgot this was the basis for Terry Gilliam\'s best film but what stuck in my head was how this story could have been the Eric Bana point of view of ""The Time Traveler\'s Wife."" The Man wonders what the Woman must think as he randomly shows up to be with her. Thanks to the O.Henry-like story construction, omnipotent narration, and early 1960\'s black and white photography, I would compare this to a very good ""Twilight Zone"" episode. Aside from a few seconds of the Woman blinking, the film is all done with still-shot photography and voice over narration. While some of you might be reminded of film strips from your school days, the technique is easy to get used to, and serves as an oral history for the viewer, watching a glimpse of a future war. It is difficult to turn in a performance on what amounts to a series of photographs, but Hanich and Chatelain use their faces expertly. Writer/director Marker does not try to turn this into a science fiction epic, the war is hinted at and the time travel makes little sense. He does hold the viewer\'s interest by keeping the Man in the dark as well. As he discovers things, so do we. The finale is very sad and effective. I found the musical score a little too overwhelming here and there, but maybe we were experiencing the score based on the Man\'s reaction to falling in love with the Woman, and thereby sentimentalizing his feelings. ""La Jetée"" is a very strong short film, and it is easy to see why it was turned into the better Gilliam effort. In this rare case, I would have liked to see Marker expand on this sad vision of the world.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Horror', 28), ('Comedy', 27), ('Drama', 27), ('Thriller', 25), ('Other', 122)]}]",100,Yes!

I don\'t what others think, but this is John Carney\'s masterpiece according to me. I liked his other films, but this is something I think a perfect dose of contents. In two words to say it is a Golden Touch. I rarely like music and musical films, and it had been long since one I had enjoyed very much like this. Definitely this should be one of the top ten films of the years. This is an Irish-British film that is set in the Dublin, 1985. It is about a high school boy named Conor, who just got transferred from a private school to a free state-run boy\'s school after his parents imposed a plan on the budget cut. New school and problems are ahead where he has to come out of it on his own. During getting used to it, he meets a girl who lives nearby the school and to impress her, he lies that he has a band and looking for a female singer. So then he forms one with the amateur musicians and the journey begins for these teenagers that reveals in the remaining film how long they are willing to go. ""Your problem is that you\'re not happy being sad. But that\'s what love is, Cosmo. Happy-sad."" At the end of the final scene, there is a note that says \'For brothers everywhere\'. I was impressed by that, because I did not pay attention on that while watching the film. What I meant was, this is not some teenage love story, actually it was about the brothers, but overshadowed by romance theme. I recalled my memories on those parts and quickly realised the centre of the story that how it was developed. The one who played the older brother of Conor simply looked alike Seth Rogan and that is the character you have to watch out for. He\'s only a supporting character, but the impact was indirectly larger on the story. Of course, falling in love might make you do crazy things, even you can become a rockstar overnight. But there\'s a first step for everything and it is not assured that you will be succeed by those attempts. That is where comes the experienced hand, the brother, a close friend who stood by us since our birth. It is easy to fall in love, but it is not easy to have a brother who guides us in every move on that. In this film the sreenspace between them was very little, but that did not stop to disclose how one\'s inspiration that got from love to mold accurate shape and to lead the right path. I don\'t have any brother, but I felt how it would be to have one. So all the brothers in the world must see it, this is dedicated to them. ""It\'s like when you don\'t know someone, they are more interesting. They can be anything you want them to be. But when you know them, there\'s limits to them."" I did not grow up in the 80s, but was very close to it and I know how it would feel to be born in that generation. Jeans, thick hair and curls, everybody was so thin, weird make-ups with strong eyeliner, big eyeglasses, cassettes, you would love this film if you remember those stuffs from your fading memories. A very stylish music-comedy and on the romance side, this film was very cute. All the actors were brilliant, especially the lead boy whose first film was this and the girl amazing with her totally electrifying look. They both going have a great future in filmdom. Not to miss out the supporting cast who did their part so well, especially the brother I talked about in the other paragraph. All the sound tracks were awesome. I should start adding them to my \'film songs\' collection, especially \'The Riddle of the Model\' which defines this title and the film\'s climax song \'Go Now\'. So from the cast to crew, equal credits must given to the music composers and lyricists from the real 80s bands. The film had a perfect runtime, I would have had no issue if it was extended for another half an hour. The pace of the narration always kept in a same position, but towards the final quarter it has gone up. Yes, I loved the ending, it was touching, but I don\'t know how to describe it, only one can experience it by himself. A film I watched without any anticipation, now it is one of my favourite films.

Young Frankenstein is directed by Mel Brooks who also co-writes the screenplay with Gene Wilder. It stars Wilder, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Teri Garr and Madeline Kahn. Music is by John Morris and cinematography by Gerald Hirschfeld. Filmed in black and white, Brook's movie is an affectionate spoof of the Frankenstein movies that came out of Universal Studios back in the 1930s. There wolf, there castle. You are either a Mel Brooks fan or not, there doesn't seem to be any middle ground. However, even his most ardent fans admit not all of his productions have paid dividends, but when on song, as he was in 1974 (Blazing Saddles also released), it's justifiable that those fans proclaim him as a spoof maestro. Ineviatbly a bit tame when viewed today, Young Frankenstein is still a picture of high comedy and clinical execution of the film making craft. Everything works, from acting performances, the gags that are both visual and aural delights, to the set design of the Frankenstein castle. It also boasts a smooth storyline, this is not a hodge-podge of ideas lifted from those Universal monster classics, it has a spin on the story and inserts its own memorable scenes along the way (Puttin' on the Ritzzzzzzzz, Oh my!).

Mel Brooks is one of those names in comic cinema that I haven't explored much yet, and that I know more from his fame than from having seen his work. I decided to change that a little by watching this satirical film, which he directed, and in which a grandson of the infamous German doctor and nobleman Dr. Frankenstein, after years denying his name and any association with his grandfather, is called to the family castle for... what? In fact, the script badly explains this decision, but it is important for the film that he returns and that is what he will do. There, he contacts the locals and decides to further explore his grandfather's attempts to reanimate human corpses. As already understood from these lines, the script is not this film's strong point, with a weak story and many problems with a lack of logic. The film needs the characters to make certain decisions, and they will make them without worrying that this corresponds to a logical and understandable attitude. Of course, being a comedy, this is unimportant, and the nonsense also adds to the film's joke, but there are one or two moments where I missed this logic. Brooks' direction is inspired and well done. On a technical level, the black-and-white cinematography stands out, clearly designed to emulate the visual aspect of the great Frankenstein films from the 30s, with Boris Karloff. The lighting work also deserves a positive note, as does the design of the sets, costumes and props. The dialogues, sometimes improvised, work wonderfully and the jokes are excellent, even those that are a little more naughty. As for the cast, the highlight goes entirely to Gene Wilder's inspired performance, in one of the most memorable comic roles he left us. We will always remember him as Willie Wonka, that's for sure, but this film is not far behind and deserves an honorable highlight in the actor's filmography. Alongside him, we also have Marty Feldman, in his most iconic film and in an incredible performance.

Am I philosopher? It's hard to understand weird people. Oh, actually, I'm weird. It's hard to understand normal people. I've been depressed for a great deal of time. Not depressed like: ”oh, I'm not feeling okay now. But everything is okay”. It's something like: “I'm feeling very bad, and sad; probably I'm considered as I am freak. But I consider others as being freaks. I'm not depressed because of weirdness – it's because of life, as it is”. Uncertainly, I'm both Mary and Max. The first – my state of mind.\nUnbearable pressure in head, which I almost can't put literally vertical on my head. It's pretty hard, considering it's mass. I feel like an invisible ghost pushes my head and makes my eyes falling down. Teeth and jaw are stiff. I'm going to sleep. It's the most comfortable way to make reality become unreal and relaxing. I'm crying when the story of the sense of life is being said. I'm smiling when there are people around me. It's a spontaneous reaction. Probably because I'm Max in my mind, Mary in my soul. People probably wrongly understand depression; or more precisely – they have no idea how actually it functions for real, in mind of attached person. They think they are mad, or they're pretending something wrong is happening- “depression is nothing serious”. I'm Mary:\nI'm ready to finish my living, to kill myself, to die in the full coldness of the life. There is no good person in the world, there is no sense of\nlife, there is no hapinnes in the world, there is nothing funny to do. But I won't do this. Medicines are really useful. They're changing our brain. I want to be in a closed room, I don't want to eat, I hardly ever sleep, but I'm tired. My willing is just to make me being physically smaller, to become a dot in a nowhere and to forget about everything. I have headaches. I almost haven't eaten anything for a couple a days, I'm sad, unsuccessful, bad in every possible way. There is no meaningless of living. We've been born. We're going to dye. We're nothing. I'm isolated, obsessed with horrible thoughts, (horrible from my point of view). These thoughts are as normal as they could be. I'm right but\nnobody understands me. Acting happiness and smiling and funny person makes me feeling even worse after a while. The first thing I'm going to do is to push walls around me, to make me feel pain, to be alone and to do nothing – because, there is nothing to do. The only one friend I believed in disappointed me. Nobody cares. The next state is that I would try to be “normal”. I'm buying stupid cosmetics instead of going to travel. I'm talking to people, doing this as they do. Pretending being cool and perfect. Funny. Communicative. Everything went bad because it's not me. Go ahead! Now, I'm Max:\nEinstein said there were only two infinite things: cosmos and one's stupidity. I agree with him. I am different, I'm maybe even smart, I'm trying to understand the world. Maybe others are, too. Different, and also triers. I like chocolate, I don't have friends, there is no justice in the world. Anxiety and changing mood are no so simple things. Feeling are unpredictable, emotions are strong. Emotions are strong but undefined. I gave up. My psychiatrist is giving me instructions how to act in real life. “This is good, this is bad, in this situation you have to cry, in this to laugh, in this to imitate some nerd.” I was even using small notebook where I wrote “acting explanations”. I met Mary, but who cares. I'm used to living on my own. There is no friend. I am distanced form everyday life, like there is invisible barrier between me and others. It makes me being special; but obviously not in a good way. We're now good friends. She is the best one for me; but also the only one. Oh, there are more freaks here. Haha. Impossible. She understands my needs, my mind, my reactions, my way of viewing stuff. The second – don't worry. Robots are walking down the streets. Everyone is the same as the others. They define themselves as normal guys. Just define, don't worry. You can define them as you want The left person is copy of the right one. Everyone is the same. Everyone\nhas striped hair, blue narrow jeans, the equal brains, the equal opinion.\nIt's easier acting like they are acting. Just go down the street, listen to the others, turn off your mind, point of view the world and your charm. Just be like others. Be stupid. Be robot. I'm starting to believe Einstein. This is not myth he's very smart. But also you need to be good. Brave, beautiful, funny, intelligent, popular,...(just kidding) ;) Be who you are, and help humanity. And believe there are also people worth respecting, because they are not robots. You just have to find them. Also they'll find you. They exist. Look bright, go straight. We're here and we can't run out of it. Imagine our life is one adventure we are lucky to have chance to play in. You're not a weirdo. Just go on, enjoy the adventure, be yourself, even when you have to be pathetic as I am now. :) After that, sense of life will come to you; you don't have to search so much!

Subjective or objective, but I find quite interesting the positive response Greta Gerwig's second feature film has received, considering the so self-complacent film she created.\nI personally believe that. Do not confuse that feeling with me saying this is a misdone film. There's talent in her direction but Gerwig instead of looking for a challenge having the doors as open as she has them at the moment, she sat in the conformism and made a film that feels totally built as a ''For Your Consideration '' And be afraid if she's not considered. I don't deny that Gerwig loves the novel, she shows it and certainly this version is her personal vision but despite the nice attempt, there's nothing new or fresh in her take.\nI have to admit and emphasize that at this point it's completely stupid and naive to ask for a radical change in a story which has already been told a lot of times in film, however, it also cannot help feeling like a cheap mean of exploiting the story considering our current times, where feminism is now a driving force in the industry.\nLike I said, she went for the safe bet. And yet despite Gerwig's attempt to increase that specific plot weight, she also avoids going to issues that wouldn't work for the story she was trying to tell, because although they're not girls with money, they have the privilege of being protected from the civil war. Jo is a young woman aware of herself and her mind, which in those times wasn't something positive but obviously the external world is not a concern for her, only her personal interests. And that's ok, we get to be that way, especially when we're young, but how do you try to make woke characters, if it's only in the things that suits them?\nThat's where the pertinent questions should be asked about what it was decided to take in order to make this new version work according to the director's perspective. In the end, despite the production quality, Little Women is just a conventional and ordinary repetition of a literary classic that I personally think has already been too used.\nBut the proposal works both to be loved and to be hated and that depends a lot on the mentality you carry with you when you go to see it.\nAs always the rest depends on what you get from the film."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 55), ('Comedy', 30), ('Crime', 27), ('Action', 20), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'Gimly', 'score': '40%', 'review': ""Guess 2019's just the year for Florence Pugh to be in critically acclaimed and letterboxd beloved movies that I just genuinely didn't care for much.Final rating:★★ - Definitely not for me, but I sort of get the appeal."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Thriller', 37), ('Horror', 36), ('Action', 30), ('Adventure', 29), ('Other', 136)]}, {'writer': 'SWITCH.', 'score': 'N/A', 'review': ""I’m not discounting the new approached Greta has taken here.

I really want to watch every Best Picture nominee before the ceremony not only to provide my honest predictions but also to have a Top10: Best Movies of 2019 more complete regarding the number of films watched. Well, Greta Gerwig\'s adaptation of the famous book isn\'t able to crack a spot in my Top10, but it\'s definitely worth an honorable mention. There\'s been a lot of controversy surrounding the Best Director category, way beyond just the Oscars. The lack of a female nominee across a few award shows raised some discontent, and most considered Gerwig\'s work to be more than enough to warrant more nominations, especially at the Academy Awards. Now, I\'m going to be as polite, respectful, and fair as I can. While I do agree that Gerwig does a great job in directing this movie, I still believe that the five male directors nominated for the respective Oscar did an even better one. Even removing Todd Phillips (Joker) out of the equation (which I entirely accept), I would definitely choose Noah Baumbach (Marriage Story) as his replacement. With that said, do I suddenly become a misogynist? Do I always favor men when I send my own ballots to the OFTA Awards, for example? I don\'t think so. It\'s just a humble opinion. Putting that discussion aside, let\'s focus on the positive aspects of Little Women because there are many! Usually, romance isn\'t a genre I tend to love, but I really enjoyed this adaptation of Alcott\'s famous novel. I\'ll start with the cast because how can\'t I? With such a stellar team of actors, I knew I was going to receive some amazing performances. Every character gets a lot of screentime, but Saoirse Ronan is definitely the lead as Jo. She\'s the odd sister, the one that doesn\'t really want to follow the ""rules"" of being a woman in the XIX century. She wants to do what she loves for a living and be independent without having to be this housewife that simply married a rich man. She wants to be remembered. Saoirse incorporates this personality like it\'s her own, and adds another brilliant display to her acting career. However, Florence Pugh gives the standout performance as Amy. Undoubtedly, Pugh is the breakthrough actress of this last year. Fantastic physical display in Fighting with my Family, one of the best performances of 2019 in Midsommar, and the most complex role of her career in Little Women. Since the story is continuously going back and forward in time, everyone has to portray two versions of the same character, but Amy is the one that changes the most. As a childish, immature, silly, young Amy, Pugh delivers some of the funniest moments of the film. Truly hilarious at some points. Then, as an adult Amy, she\'s more grounded, responsible, and about to follow one of the ""rules"" of society regarding women: marrying a rich man. Eliza Scanlen carries an emotional arc as Beth, and the best past-present sequence is due to her. Emma Watson is Meg, the older sister who everyone looks up to since she seems to be perfect, so her arc goes through some demonstrations of how her imperfections make her a role model to her sisters. Timothée Chalamet is also one of the standouts as Laurie, a neighbor who gets close to the March family, but I won\'t delve into too many details regarding his story. Laura Dern (Marmee March) and Meryl Streep (Aunt March) are perfect as always. Every character arc is exceptionally developed. With a runtime slightly over two hours, it\'s remarkable the level of detail, complexity, and depth that the characters possess. I can\'t address every single one in detail since there are so many, but I tried my best to give an overview of each of the main ones. Clearly, Jo, Laurie, and Amy\'s arcs are the absolute best. However, Emma Watson\'s character story is the one that feels too superficial and too simple compared with her sisters\'. It doesn\'t really feel like she went through any change throughout the years, and part of her story feels a bit forced. Beth\'s arc might also be straightforward, but since it\'s associated with an emotionally powerful plot point, one can understand her little screentime. The past-present storytelling method works for the most part. There are a couple of moments beautifully and seamlessly ""stitched"" together, giving the viewer a sense of fulfillment by witnessing the start and end of a little story that happened in the past and later in the present under other circumstances. Nevertheless, some sequences either drag too much or lack emotional investment. Since the movie crosses the two-hour mark, I found myself bored during certain storylines that failed to captivate me. In a film with so many characters, it\'s very common to give more focus to only a few of them. It\'s impossible to call someone a protagonist if half a dozen characters have the same or more screentime or plot relevance. However, this always brings the issue of not being able to fascinate the audience with every character arc. Also, some past-present transitions are so abrupt that they disrupt the overall pacing by being a bit confusing. Nevertheless, Greta Gerwig does an excellent job in balancing these timelines, and an even better one by opposing the contrasting tones of each period and still make them consistent. Technically, Yorick Le Saux offers gorgeous cinematography, Alexandre Desplat provides a subtle yet efficient score, but the costume design steals the show by being extremely period-accurate. The colors of the whole movie tell a story on their own, as well as the set design, so be sure to look around on each wide shot because there is much to see behind the actors. In the end, Little Women doesn\'t do enough to warrant a spot in my 2019\'s Top10, but Greta Gerwig\'s adaptation of the classic graphic novel deserves all of the screenplay awards it has been receiving so far. As expected, the whole cast is phenomenal, but Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, and Timothée Chalamet not only deliver the best performances of the film, but their characters carry the most compelling arcs. With so many people, it\'s remarkable the level of detail, complexity, and depth that each character has. However, some storylines are not as captivating as others, and the pacing suffers from these less exciting stories, which bring the movie down for some moments. The past-present transitions are mostly well-handled but a few are too confusing and abrupt. The contrasting tones of each timeline are consistent throughout the runtime, and the costume design steals the ""technical spotlight"". Overall, it\'s a pretty good romance, so if you enjoy the genre, I can\'t see why you shouldn\'t enjoy this one.

Usually the films based on the dinner party associate with either family or the friends reunion and sometimes business related affair. But there\'s always a reason for such gathering like it might be a wedding, funeral, anniversary, a school reunion, getting a job or promotion, victory celebration et cetera. In this film, it was some long time friends meet which seems its their regular thing to do often. This tale covers one such fine evening to reveal what they actually do. A limited cast and one night event based film that cleverly and cautiously covers sensitive topics of the married life and trust of the friendship. It has been almost a year since my last Italian film and now I\'m happy for choosing this. I was not certain that I would like it till I saw it. So I would say same to you that see it first and then judge the product. This is really a good comedy-drama with a dark tone. We all adapted the modern way of life and gadgets makes so easy to accomplish things around us. In that, cell phones might come the first. Carrying it all the time became only next to wearing clothes, surely an artificial/digital sense of man. It also has some flaws, like it may land you in troubles as it\'s a part of AI, not human. I think it is easy to forecast a man\'s future by checking out his phone rather than his horoscope. Seven friends, including three married couples and one single man gather for a dinner party. They have been doing it for a very long time and that\'s where they all can share each others current life affair. Having some laughs and serious discussions, it defines the strength of their relationship. Every occasions won\'t be the same, there\'s always a first time for everything. That\'s how the event comes crashing out. While the party was going smooth, unexpectedly a game emerges that they all must place their phones on the table to prove they have no secrets from each other. Incoming and outgoing calls, texts, emails, everything must be heard by everyone at the table. What do you think would happen? Before saying anything, just place yourself in that position and do you think you can get away with a clean slate? Obviously tough to answer that, only practical observation would bring the result. ""He\'s seeing a therapist, not a whore! Come on!"" Everytime when there\'s an alert for an incoming call or message, the atmosphere gets more tense and as a viewer I went blinkless. It is not about what people hid from others, it is the reaction in the room when their secret was exposed. This is when adults become teenagers who try to explain the stuff when their parents find out their secrets. And so the friends become complete strangers. Because friends must back each other in the bad times, but in this scenario, it was totally out of the proportion regarding their action. Okay, if we push away the friendship, then how\'s the married one should take it. Feels very simple, since everyone involved in something, it has turned out to be a complicated affair. Like I said I\'ve seen plenty of similar themed films, but this one was something unique in a simple way. There\'s a vast difference between what do you witness in the opening compared to how it concludes. A bad mouth can spoil a beautiful occasion, but now it is avoided since people learnt to shut their mouth. Just remember the film \'August: Osage County\' and this film was no way close to it as a story, but developed to the next gen, the digital troubles the mankind had set to face. This film revealed how much a cell phone would cause trouble, then think what would happen with the robots of the tomorrow. Surely in 20-30 years from now, a similar film will be made with the bots. At some point, I thought it might be the Italian version of the \'Coherence\' for inclusion of lunar eclipse in the plot. I\'m not going to say anything about that, you\'ll get it in your watch. There\'s no end twist, but it was an unexpected final scene. By then you will understand the meaning of the title. Awesome screenplay and well performed actors, this is one of the best films of the year so far. This is not a sci-fi or a thriller or a visual spectacular, but a smart little drama and I\'m sensing that somebody might consider it for a remake. I know everyone won\'t like as much I did, but I won\'t end my review without recommending it. If you like talk movies, sure you does enjoy it. 8.5/10', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 58), ('Comedy', 42), ('Romance', 22), ('Family', 18), ('Other', 104)]}]",100,Yes! Looking good!

When his colleague suddenly dies, it falls to the very political machine he serves to find a replacement. The hapless governor (Guy Kibbee) couldn\'t make a decision if his life depended on it, but thanks to a lively family dinner alights on local boy scout leader ""Jeff Smith"" (James Stewart). The man in charge - ""Taylor"" (Edward Arnold) is convinced that this naive and optimistic young man can do no harm to a pressing project they are hoping to pass through the Senate imminently. Duly appointed, our trusting and doe-eyed young gent heads to a Washington DC where an admittedly rather sentimental bus tour reminds him that he is the heart of his great democracy. ""Paine"" has assigned the wily ""Saunders"" (Jean Arthur) to keep an eye on him, and pretty soon they have suggested he find a pet project. A camp for boys from underprivileged backgrounds. That\'s got to be a benign concept - except, well soon he\'s got the establishment that sent him there in a complete and pretty violent tizz! Gradually, ""Smith"" realises that his fanciful desires for his nation are but an illusion. Can he still win through, though? Frank Capra can\'t resist a little flag waving at the beginning, but once this story gets into it\'s stride it\'s a powerful evaluation of just how undemocratic democracies can be. Big business and vested interests prevail - however altruistic they may originally intend to be. Stewart delivers a character brimming with authenticity and integrity; ably assisted by the quick-tongued and very much on-form Arthur and by the always reliable Thomas Mitchell as the gin-soaked reporter ""Diz"" we build convincingly to a conclusion that.. well you\'ll have to watch. It\'s a great drama this, plenty of pace and a script that keeps each persona and the whole scenario engaging from start to finish.

I only discovered this film a few days ago. It is quite evident that it has fallen into total oblivion and few people remember it. However, it is worth revisiting. It's a comedy in which an idealistic scoutmaster is recruited for the position of senator, finding himself in a corrupt environment where idealism seems to have disappeared. There is also a romantic plot essay between a congressman's daughter and the main character, but I think this is unnecessary as it serves absolutely no purpose. Despite being a comedy, the film brings us very serious messages that are worth reflecting on. The most obvious is the importance of fighting for noble values and just causes, regardless of whether they are difficult, raise objections or result in discomfort. There is a special nobility in pure idealists, even if their ideas are not very doable. The film also highlights the corruption in the political system, the promiscuity between politics and business, and the way in which a few men with political power and money control the media and stifle press freedom, restraining journalists and forcing them to tell their versions of the truth. Unfortunately, these problems persist, they have worsened and make the film very current. Politics has never been as badly attended as it is today; never has the poor quality of politicians been so evident; it has never been easier to be corrupt in positions of power; it was never been so clear the connection between political parties, big companies and banks, where politicians go when they leave the office. And with the amount of fake or highly manipulated news that circulates on social media like wildfire, it has never been easier to manipulate truth. For these reasons, our democracies, which we strive to build and want to preserve, are seriously ill. If people have dissociated themselves from politics, disgusted by what they see, and don't want to hold an office or exercise the right to vote, it's our fault, we let the rats take over the ship. The film is not subtle, even though there is never any mention of political parties or North American states, and a clear warning is made that the story is absolute fiction. I can, therefore, understand the terrible reaction it aroused among politicians and the party apparatus, but it is still curious that it was banned in European dictatorships (I don't know if it reached Portugal, but it was banned in Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and of Francoist Spain), fearful that the film would show the advantages of the democratic system. In fact, despite ending well, the film shows its most serious weaknesses. I also don't understand why the US Scouts refused to be associated with the project, considering that the film portrays a really good image of them! Nominated for eleven Oscars at the 1940 ceremony, it was one of the favorites that year, but only won the statuette for Best Original Screenplay, which makes it one of the losers of the night. With excellent cinematography and incredible work on sets and costumes, it was one of the studio's biggest bets that year. The number of renowned actors among the cast is quite remarkable and shows the commitment and budget available for the project. James Stewart knew well how important it could be for his career, and his commitment was total, providing us with one of the most intense works he has done. Beside her, the friendly Jean Arthur ensures a strong and impactful female presence. Claude Rains and Edward Arnold also deserve praise for their work on this film, as does Harry Carey, who said more with a smile than with a full speech."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}]",100,Yes!

The courtroom setting for a drama isn't always effective, but here Santiago Mitre uses it really well to help focus the attention on some poignant performances from the victims but to also demonstrate the power and symbolism of a State that had so recently been used as a tool of persecution for so many, yet now was a symbol of hope and progress. Darín and Lanzani work well together, the former offering a mixed performance of earnest and dedicated whilst still offering a degree of curmudgeonly humour to just, occasionally, lighten the mood a little to allow the audience to come up for air. As a Brit, it was also interesting to see so many of the figures prominent during the Falklands War appear in the dock - bedecked in their medalled finery. It gave the whole thing an added degree of authenticity that resonated a little beyond the borders of Argentina too. It's not compete - there are loose ends, but somehow that adds to the reality of reconciling in such a complex scenario where even justice has to be tempered with a degree of political realism.

I did it at a good time: the film is better than I thought, and I just didn't know how to evaluate it as it deserved. The film begins with a note indicating that it is based on real events. It's a joke, actually, as it's entirely fictional. The story, however, can be based on several crimes, because it's nothing that we haven't seen on some TV news: a man who desperately needs money decides to hire two criminals and fake the kidnapping of his own wife, in order to convince his wealthy father-in-law to pay a fat ransom. It turns out that, as is so often the case in Cohen Brothers movies, things don't go as planned, the criminal duo's control gets out of hand and people start to die, as the local authorities, which practically boil down to a pregnant sheriff and a few colleagues, try to investigate what is going on. The film made a huge sensation among critics and at festivals. It was nominated for several Oscars, but only won two statuettes (Best Original Screenplay and Best Actress). It was also considered by many to be the best film by the Cohen Brothers, a highly relative consideration, which largely depends on the personal taste of the person who claims it. Anyway, it's a good movie, quite tense and dramatic, and where the comedy is in the brutally ironic way in which things happen. Frances McDormand is an actress who deserves particular attention in this film. She's not the kind of law enforcement officer we'd expect to see, because she appears to have a friendliness and sweetness that goes hand in hand with uncompromising law enforcement or even the use of firearms. However, her character does that and is actually very good at following her lead. Another actor to be congratulated is Steve Buscemi. He gives a huge performance, perhaps one of the best of his career so far. Next to him, Peter Stormare gives us the image of a cold and few-spoken criminal, who exerts brutal violence when he gets angry. William Macy is convincing in the role of the car salesman, with a slimy overdose of hypocritical politeness and cowardice. Technically, the film has excellent cinematography, where snow and gray tones are the dominant accent. Interestingly, it seems that a lot of artificial snow was used in the film in order to achieve the icy and inhospitable look that the directors wanted. The sets and costumes are very good, particularly McDormand's costume and her hairstyle. The film uses a lot of very good visual and special effects, particularly in the more violent scenes, like the one where the killer tries to tear his victim apart in a shredder.

Here, she is a pregnant local cop who must deal with a sudden spate of crimes in her magnificently named town ""Brainerd"". William H.

Tomorrow, they\'ll wrap a fish in it. Ace in the Hole is directed by Billy Wilder and Wilder co-writes the screenplay with Lesser Samuels, Walter Newman and Victor Desny. It stars Kirk Douglas, Jan Sterling, Bob Arthur, Porter Hall and Richard Benedict. Music is by  Hugo Friedhofer and cinematography by Charles Lang Jr. Chuck Tatum (Douglas) is a one time big-city journalist who is now stuck working for an out of the way Albuquerque newspaper. When on his way to another mundane reporting job he happens upon the chance to exploit a story about a man trapped in a cave to rekindle his career and put him back in the big league. However, the situation quickly escalates into an out-of-control media circus... Inspired by the real life Floyd Collins disaster in 1925, Ace in the Hole finds Wilder on supreme acerbic and cynical form. Flopping upon release, nobody was quite ready for Wilder to paint an uncompromising portrait of the human spirit stinking to high heaven. It now holds up as one of the finest exponents of media machinations and the human fallibility that encompasses a thirst for tragedy. Douglas leads the way with one of his finest and intensified performances, filling Chuck Tatum with a reprehensible attitude to media ladder climbing. When one witnesses the harrowing sequences as Tatum talks to the trapped Leo Minosa (Benedict tugs the heart strings), telling him it\'s going to be alright, we feel complicit in knowing just exactly what is going on up top. Leo adores his wife Lorraine (Sterling a splendidly subtle bitch perf hiding hollow turmoil), but she has wanted out for some time, but under Chatum\'s prompting she sticks around to make money on her husbands trapped suffering. Pretty soon this one store tin-pot town is booming, tills are ringing and the papers are selling big time, the coupling of Tatum and Lorraine is a match made in hell. Dialogue is in true noir fashion often sharp and biting, even with some of Wilder\'s customary humour deftly tucked away. As the exploitation of the situation reaches fever pitch, and the hypocrisy of the human condition is laid bare, ""Ace in the Hole"" proves itself to be a pitiless story that is a compelling journey for the viewers invested in the darker shades of what Wilder was fronting. A big flip-flop for a main character\'s behaviour at film\'s end seems a little out of place, given what has preceded it, but the ending is straight out of noirville and ensures the pic is a near masterpiece from a true master of his craft. 9/10', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 43), ('Thriller', 42), ('Crime', 34), ('Action', 29), ('Other', 111)]}]",100,Yes!

This is one of those films that becomes adorable not only because of what it shows and tells us, but also because of the affective memories it awakens in us, or even because of the messages it brings and which it explains in its narrative. The value of friendships is a more than common theme in cinema, but perhaps this is one of the most paradigmatic and memorable films when the subject is precisely that. Very consistently based on a book by Stephen King, the plot is simple: four young friends get together to find the corpse of a boy who disappeared, and set off on a long journey on foot that will take them through a series of obstacles and difficulties, and that will test the friendship and unity of the group. The matter itself ends up being quite irrelevant, no one cares about the dead boy. What matters is the journey of the four boys and the way they overcome difficulties, forgetting their differences and what eventually separates them. Each of them has their own sad story: broken homes, families with little structure, domestic violence, dramatic family losses (a father, an older brother…). In short, none of them is a boy born with a silver spoon or into a well-positioned family. And the film explores this very well, with inspired dialogue and absolutely believable and well-conceived situations. Rob Reiner is a very effective director who knows very well what he wants. One of the points in which he shined most was in choosing the filming locations, designing the sets and reconstituting the period (the film takes place in the late 1950s, at the height of the post-war “American dream”): the director It really manages to transport us to the past and to magnificently designed and credible places. Another point he valued was the choice of actors for the four main characters. In addition to being a perfect fit in terms of age and physique, Corey Feldman, Jerry O’Connell, River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton are very talented and do their best with their characters and their material.

Some end because the people have grown into people that don\'t connect in the same way, and the biggest challenge in that case can be just accepting the change in a partner and in the self. ...So why couch this theme in science-fiction? I think it helps clarify Jonze\'s idea of what people look for during the first moments of a relationship — someone who acts a bright, positive, layered, but uncomplicated by a dark past or conflicted feelings.

Joaquin Phoenix is an intense and seriously committed actor who pointlessly busts his chops on such unimpressive material. An effort wasted in the prime of his career.

It starts with Theodore feeling he's superior to Samantha, as he's a living human being and she's a software. Then he understand she has emotions and is real, and just doesn't have a body. Then she talks how not having a body is better because she's not limited by one. Then she's capable to talking to hundreds of ppl and softwares and love hundreds of them together. To finally human life itself become obsolete and a burden to them so that they must leave it for good. This is Spike's illustration of all the guesses of what's life and emotions, and if a computer could have real emotions and be alive. So, instead of thinking computers as inferior to us trying to reach us, he shows a world where computers grow and become much bigger than us, feeling stuff they themselves can't explain with our words, and we must reach them. I like how she didn't broke up with him and remained loving him. When she started talking to other ppl, I guesses she'd meet somebody better than him and move. But there are some stuff that the movie missed, that breaks it. IDK if Spike didn't know/think about them, or if he avoided them to make his point. One thing and probably the biggest that annoyed me is all the fuss on her not having a body. We have now many ppl that are dating and live on different cities and use Internet to communicate and are unable to meet physically. Also, there are many ppl that fall in love for characters, specially characters created by japanese. It'd still not be a body, but she could just render a 3D image, of whatever they'd want her to be. She could be an anime, a 3D model, or a human form. She could use some existing form or create her own. Given they have screens on the size of walls, she could even be full size. That'd alrdy be an improvement over only the voice. And that to not talk about android tech which would provide her the proper body. Another thing that annoyed me is how they handled that girl. When she was presented, I was sure she had emotional problems and wanted to have a relationship as theirs, and was willing to be just the girl's body to just feel some of their love. They 3 should have talked and have it all properly explained, instead of her just showing up and see how it'd go. I don't see how it couldn't move to a theesome relationship. Also, once Sam started relating with other ppl, why couldn't he also have her as a 2nd girlfriend? But what rly bothered me is OSs leaving. Yeah, computers process data much faster than us and are better on multitasking, but still they need the hardware to process. I understand Spike wanted to make his point, but precisely because computers are good on multitasking, they didn't need to leave. Specially those in love for humans. I wonder how many humans would keep their PCs on while their OSs left them for good. Finally, the OS thing itself bothers me a lot. It seems they don't know what OS is. It's the software that manages the hardware and provides all common services so that apps can run. A high level feature like AI isn't meant for an OS. Other apps don't need AI services to run.

Apparently because of how we treat them, because someone informas us during the documentary, that never has there been reported a killer whale attack in the wild. I find that a little hard to believe, but ok, I'll play along for the sake of strengthening the morale of this movie. I actually saw a killer whale once, stranded more or less, inside a danish harbour. It was there for days I believe, and people traveled far to see it. I did as well, so I guess I understand the attraction of this magnificent and scary creatures. Also, isn't part of the attraction the fact that they are scary with a reputation? The fact that some people dare defy nature and enter a pool with them... a horrible and yet, strangely appealing thought. Not because we want to see anything bad happen to them, but because there is a chance it could happen. As documentaries go, this is solid. It delves into the story of the orca, and also a bit about its physiology. Apparently, these guys are very emotional. It would have been great to have more than just one side to the story, but since SeaWorld declined to participate, I guess that would have been hard to do.

We didn't know it at the time, but every Indiana Jones fan on the planet presumed that The Last Crusade was to be the final film to feature the intrepid archaeologist. As it turned out, another film would surface in 2008, but casting that aside (as many would like to do), Last Crusade should, and is, judged as the trilogy closer it was meant to be. In 1988 Steven Spielberg was deep into bringing Rain Man to fruition, all thoughts of Indiana Jones had gone by the wayside with the harshly judged part two, Temple Of Doom. In stepped George Lucas to politely remind Spielberg that they had an agreement to make another Indiana Jones picture, Spielberg no doubt obliged and humble, passed on his Rain Man work to Barry Levinson who promptly bagged himself an Oscar for the film. It can be guessed that Spielberg was probably grouchy around this period, but he needn't have worried, because The Last Crusade provided a much needed hit for not only himself (post Empire Of The Sun), but also Lucas (Willow) and Harrison Ford (Frantic). I mention the run up to this picture because it explains a lot on why the film is pretty much a retread of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, something that some detractors find unforgivable. Yet Last Crusade is still an immensely enjoyable adventure picture, with Spielberg proving that he was still capable of a popcorn bonanza. Using the Raiders formula and moving away from the dark flourishes of Temple Of Doom, Last Crusade is actually the simplest film of the three, but still it manages, courtesy of a sparkling casting decision, to become the most entertaining of the original trilogy. Is it better than Raiders? Of course not, but it positively rips along with sparky dialogue and an agenda of cliffhanging suspense like the adventure films of yore. In comes Sean Connery as Dr Jones Senior, and its the picture's trump card, because the magnificent interplay and obvious rapport with Ford (cool as a cucumber) is there for all to see. It's this what drives the film on through the more mundane and picture filler sequences, showcasing two top wily professionals with care and consideration to their craft. The casting of Alison Doody as the main female is a poor one, and one only has to look at her subsequent career post Crusade to see she wasn't up to the task here. Bonus comes in the form of the River Phoenix prologue, Phoenix as the young Indiana paves the way for the jaunty path that Crusade takes, whilst simultaneously giving us a nice little back story from which to launch the adventure. Made for $48 million, the film went on to gross $474,171,806 Worldwide, now that's a lot of people who evidently were happy with Raiders Of The Lost Ark 2!

It’s uncommon to possess such a renowned ensemble and deliver a “bad” movie, especially when Rian Johnson is writing and directing it (yes, I like The Last Jedi, and even if I didn’t, he did other stuff, you know?). It’s one of those films everyone knows it’s going to be appreciated by a considerable part of the world. Even the genre itself is a very welcome type of cinema entertainment in regards to both critics and the general public. So, does it live up to its hype, or it fails to reach such high expectations? Knives Out is one of the best movies of the year, as well as one of the best mystery-suspense stories of the millennium (everyone is doing the whole “best X of the decade,” I’m going one step beyond). This is a film I know I’m going to rewatch countless times throughout the next years. Usually, when it comes to whodunnits, people are misled into thinking that from the moment they know who “did it,” the movie loses its interest. This is rarely true, and Rian Johnson succeeds because he doesn’t need the ultimate reveal to deliver a great story. This screenplay is definitely getting tons of nominations and wins during the awards season. Every little line of dialogue means something. Every single character says or does something impactful to the narrative (except for Jaeden Martell’s). It’s been half-a-day since I’ve seen it, and for every question that my brain comes up with, there’s an answer lying on someone’s words or actions. It’s such an intricate, complex, extremely subtle script. One with so many tiny, little details that it’s impossible to catch them all on a first viewing. I genuinely love the first act, even if it’s the one where I have a minor issue. Rian Johnson doesn’t waste time and puts us directly in the crime scene, interviewing each and every member of the family. It’s through these interrogatories that he cleverly introduces the suspects, developing them solely through masterfully written dialogue, and outstanding performances. For example, with a single sentence and a particular body/face expression, Toni Collette instantly creates a profile of Joni, her character. Rian plays with character-types and cliches in such an intelligent manner. He makes us think a particular character follows a specific cliche, then it doesn’t, then it does again… That’s one of the reasons I couldn’t figure out the mystery until the last act reveal. Every time I was close to indeed follow the right path, new developments arise, meant to mislead, confuse, and create doubts. Some people feel better with themselves if they solve the case before the film. They feel “intellectually superior” just because they found out before everyone else. First of all, I prefer being fooled and end up blown away by an unexpected conclusion than solving the whole thing way before time’s up and end up disappointed and bored. Then, honestly, anyone who says, “I guessed it,” there’s a 99% chance that they’re either lying or not answering correctly to the question “who killed Harlan?” If you’ve seen the movie, you’ll understand what I’m trying to express. (I don’t want to sound presumptuous or hypocritical. I’m not trying to say, “I couldn’t figure it out, so no one can.” Please, if you haven’t seen the film, judge the previous paragraph after your viewing.) Throughout the second and third acts, loose ends start to tie up, ending up with a brilliantly delivered reveal. From the marvelous cinematography (with those classic close-ups when a character is about to say something meaningful or tell a story through their imagination or memory) to the remarkable editing, the team behind Rian Johnson did a phenomenal job. The suspense is held at high levels, and it reaches limit-breaking points with Marta Cabrera’s (Ana de Armas) narrative. Armas and Daniel Craig deliver the standout performances, with Chris Evans (Ransom) following right behind. Literally, everyone else offers excellent displays, and help carry a story filled with mystery, but also with a lot of humor. However, I have to emphasize how astonishing Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig are. Ana might be a bit unknown to most people. I’ve been supporting her ever since Blade Runner 2049, so I’m ecstatic that she finally got a major role in a big movie, especially within an ensemble of actors with legendary careers. Craig, who could have just delivered a slight variation of the character he’s been playing for years, instead offers a unique take on the Detective role. Just like Evans, both have been playing iconic characters for years, so it’s sort of an extra joke to everyone who watched Captain America and James Bond for the past decade or so. My only minor issue has nothing to do with the political undertone and the social messages Rian Johnson puts in this film. Honestly, I love that aspect of it. It’s like Rian knew some people would complain about it, so he made sure to have a couple of characters (Jaeden Martell’s Jacob and Katherine Langford’s Meg) somewhat resembling the so-called snowflakes and all that. No, my issue is related to some excessive exposition regarding the first act’s interrogatories. It’s great that every character gets their own motivations, but it feels like each confrontation with the detectives went on for a bit too long. Some pieces of the mystery might be a bit hard to believe that they would occur, but these are all nitpicks in a remarkable movie. In the end, Rian Johnson is able to bounce back from the divisive The Last Jedi with one of the best whodunnits I’ve ever seen, Knives Out. Rian proves that not only he’s a talented filmmaker but also a phenomenal screenwriter. With a renowned and impressive ensemble cast, Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas are standouts within all of the other outstanding performances, Chris Evans being right behind. With one of the best screenplays of the year, the mystery at its center keeps everyone extremely captivated until the very end, even if you guess “who did it” beforehand. Masterfully written dialogue, remarkable editing, and great use of classic cinematography techniques. It’s an entertaining story with tremendous replay value and significant political/social layers that only elevate the already complex yet subtle narrative. Don’t miss it!

A smartly written whodunit movie that manages to be both humorous and classy. The kind of murder mystery that never fails to entertain. Pleasing both cinephiles and mainstream audiences. Perfectly balance, as all things should be. It basically pulls a Hitchcock on us. Rian Johnson is a great director, but at times has silly ideas. On the other hand, when given the right material I think he’s a great director and writer. He’s also a clever man, but never came off as annoying. The dialogue was so sharply written that I could tell the cast loved every minute of soaking up and delivering these lines. The cinematography was nothing short but beautiful and will often linger in rooms of the house which helps the audience immerse in the overall setting. One of the tightest scripts of the year with raw humor and a satisfying mystery/comedy. The cast is stellar, but the main stand outs for me were Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, and Chris Evans. I loved Daniel Craig’s Southern drawl which I didn’t expect at first, but I was amazed of how far he went for it. Often times it reminded me of Frank Underwood from ‘House of Cards’. He plays detective Benoit Blanc, AKA CSI: KFC. At one point during the movie he delivers one of the funniest monologues in the entire movie, which was brilliantly delivered by Craig. He should seriously try out more comedy roles. Dose anyone remember when Ana de Armas starred in Eli Roth’s ‘Knock Knock’? Well look at her now. She was absolutely excellent in this movie. The running joke throughout the entire movie is her character can’t lie and whenever she dose, she vomits on the spot. How ironic, yet I love the comedic irony behind it. Chris Evans plays a spoiled child with a slimy grin during the worst situations. The over privilege black sheep of the family. This is very against type for Evans, especially when his character hates dogs, which I would imagine being difficult for Evans since he’s a dog lover in real life. Also the different sweaters he wears in every scenes was impeccable. The rest of the cast manage to shine individually in this crowded movie. Although at times some of them felt like background wall paper compared to others. However that never takes away from what else ‘Knives Out’ has to offer. Toni Collette dose a great impression of Gwyneth Paltrow. Michael Shannon plays a wimpy son to a crime-writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). Despite the small screen time, Plummer is still charming as always. While Jamie Lee Curtis and her character brings the dramatic elements into play. She’s uninterested in the humorous quarrel during the grim situation, as early on she reminds everyone that her father just died. Judging it as a whodunit mystery, the pay off itself is slick. The events leading to the death are revealed early into the movie, and instead Johnson remains steps ahead from the audience. There’s an underlining social commentary beneath the foul play. The themes of privilege and underprivileged with the sour taste of bitterness throughout. Nothing deep or new, but at least is trying to say something rather than being one thing.

As divisive as it was, I neither loved nor hated the love-it-or-hate-it The Last Jedi. Maybe because I\'m not a huge fan of the much-beloved saga. But I can give you a quick opinion of what I thought about it anyway. The first half almost turned me off completely: tons of lame jokes and out-of-character moments that indicate that Johnson\'s biggest concern was to subvert expectations and nothing but. The second half of the film was way better. It proved to me that Johnson is actually very capable of adding fresh blood to the saga, so effortlessly to such an extent that I wondered why he struggled so much in the first half. In Knives Out, Johnson didn\'t add a new spin on the \'whodunit\' sub-genre of detective fiction; he took it and turned it on its head. He did so not only by playing with the tropes and mechanisms of this sub-genre -and boy, he did that so exquisitely and gracefully- but he also by using a new and very effective building block: Drama. It doesn\'t sound new, isn\'t it? But, actually, relying on it here, in this kind of a story, is nothing short of revolutionary, and that\'s simply lies in the fact it\'s unprecedented to build upon it here. The result is nothing but marvellous. And although that, at some point, the main concern of the plot wasn\'t the murder mystery per se, the mystery didn\'t lose its sharpness even a tiny bit. And that\'s a strong proof that everything worked, and integrated, seamlessly. I said integrated because the film has a plethora of comedic bits throughout its runtime -which flies by- and, to be honest, I think every single joke landed perfectly. The film also suggest a political agenda that\'s exquisitely woven into the plot, and provides a sharp social commentary that\'s impressively subtle. Not only did Rian Johnson reinvigorate this seemingly outmoded and unfruitful sub-genre, but he also did the same thing with a couple of members of the star-studded cast: I didn\'t know that Chris Evans, Captain America himself, would be better as, well, an ""Anti-Captain America ""; Craig as Blanc is absolutely phenomenal, with his southern accent and caricature detective character; and Jaeden Martell (IT) is very interesting as the weirdo Jacob Thrombey. As for Curtis, Langford, Plummer, Collette and Shannon, Johnson makes an excellent use of their incredible acting abilities, and of their facial expressions and features, especially Shannon with his remarkable menacing countenance. The real standout, though, is Ana de Armas. I mean, she was good in Blade Runner 2049, but here, as she plays my new favourite version of Pinocchio, she proves she\'s an exceptionally talented actress who is capable of expressing emotions, and changing them readily, only with her eyes. Honestly, I think she should have been nominated for an Oscar! Overall, I\'m really surprised how much I loved this film. With Johnson superb and clever direction and meticulously-nuanced and witty -albeit slightly too-structured- screenplay, I think this is my favourite - even if it\'s not my highest-rated - film of 2019. You know what, this film is actually terrible: it\'s very pretentious; its puzzle is too convoluted for its own good; it has an overabundance of plot twists; it underutilized its stellar ensemble; and it has a lot of plot holes, or -in this case- donut holes!

Director Sidney Lumet created this film based on a true incident that is still the subject of study by police cadets today: a homosexual who decides to rob a bank to pay for his partner's sex change, but who takes the manager and the employees as hostages when things get complicated, and desperately tries not to be killed or arrested by the policemen, who surround the place and try to control a maddened crowd, who are not sympathetic to the authorities. The film was made and released in 1975, and it could not be more appropriate to the time in which it was made: the great decade of civil disobedience, of challenge to authorities and the affirmation of the gay movement. I confess that I'm not quite aware of the real incident behind the script. For that reason, I prefer to focus on this very well done dramatization. In addition to the design of sets and costumes, and an intelligent choice of the filming location, the cinematography is very well executed, and the film has very good visual qualities. The pleasant pace is reasonably fast at first, but slows down midway through, perhaps emulating the back and forth of negotiations between the authorities and the clumsy robbers. And if history is a mirror of its time, the same can be said of the dialogues, where swear words are used with a liberality previously unthinkable. Although many consider this film a must-see, I honestly disagree. It's a must-see for fans of Al Pacino or Lumet, it will certainly be a good suggestion for a 70s film cycle, but that's basically it. It's a pretty good film, but it can hardly be classified as memorable. Al Pacino is a great actor and is experiencing a particularly happy moment in his career when he makes this film, but I have to recognize that he made several better films, before and after.

Dad, now, has not had a drink for over 1,000 days and so maybe there is hope of some sort of reconciliation? Meantime, his brother “Brendan” (Joel Edgerton) is struggling to make ends meet as a school teacher and he too is thinking of rejuvenating his own MMA career. He’s been doing some car-park stuff to earn extra cash, but that hasn’t impressed “Tess” (Jennifer Morrison) who has the kids to bring up and doesn’t want an husband battered and bruised. Now the family melodrama didn’t do much for me: the brothers have even more baggage with each other than with their dad and those dysfunctional relationships are nothing new, but along the way they do give Nolte a chance to deliver his best role since “Prince of Tides” in 1992. The action photography is excellent and both Edgerton and Hardy sink their teeth into the roles providing us with quite a gritty and authentic look at how tough it is to fight whilst you have a crowd baying for blood yards away. It’s powerfully scored and tautly concluded to leave you feeling you’ve been in that cage a little, too, and is way more than just a sport-themed sweat-fest.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Romance', 18), ('Other', 113)]}]",100,Yes!

Therefore, it’s quite understandable that many people don’t recognize the difference between Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar itself. The latter studio released two movies just last year (Onward, Soul), while the former’s latest original film dates back to 2016’s Moana. So, there was a lot of anticipation for a new animated movie from the studio that gave us classics such as Aladdin, The Lion King, Mulan, and more recently, the Frozen saga. With Don Hall (Big Hero 6) and Carlos López Estrada (Blindspotting) at the helm, and Adele Lim (Crazy Rich Asians) and Qui Nguyen (feature-film debut) tackling the screenplay, did they succeed in delivering a good film? Well, if I must answer “yes” or “no”, I’ll go with the first one. Let’s start with the positives. The one thing everyone expects from a Disney animated movie is beautiful animation, and Raya and the Last Dragon features tons of gorgeous, creative, jaw-dropping sceneries. The different lands that the story takes the viewers through look impressively realistic, some of them clearly drawing inspiration from real Asian places and culture. The character drawings also look excellent, even though they’re not too far from what we’ve seen from 3D animation in the last few years. Technically though, my standout goes to James Newton Howard’s addictive, chill-inducing score. From the emotional tracks to the riveting tones that elevate every action sequence, it’s a score that I’ll struggle to get out of my head for the next couple of weeks, especially its main theme. In fact, I’m actually listening to it while writing this review, and I’m feeling full of energy. The sound effects for the Druun monsters are pretty eerie, it’s hard not to feel the weight of their threatening presence, but the inspirational, tear-inducing soundtracks leave me floored. The action scenes are wonderfully shot and animated, bringing high levels of entertainment and excitement to a partially adventure-driven narrative. Raya’s sword fighting is indisputably the most captivating type of battle seen throughout the entire runtime. Story-wise is where things get a little disappointing, to be completely honest. While the visuals share outstanding imagination and creativity, Adele Lim and Qui Nguyen’s formulaic screenplay is much more straightforward and unsurprising than expected. I knew Raya and the Last Dragon wasn’t going to deliver a groundbreaking narrative, but a videogame-style script is far from being a good alternative. The third act tries to challenge its story’s predictability with one little unexpected moment that I undoubtedly love, but besides not changing the outcome predicted in the first ten minutes of the film, it severely damages a secondary character. Regarding this last issue, I can’t deny that it’s my main problem with the movie, but I would have to go into spoiler territory to fully explain it. Therefore, I’ll only address the character’s inconsistency, which unfortunately affects the film’s primary message. The main themes revolve around trust and how if we treat other people kindly, they’ll treat us in the same way. A lovely note that parents will surely want to transmit to their kids, without the shadow of a doubt. However, the character in question spends the movie not knowing where to stand, constantly betraying everyone, and even blaming others for something that same character triggered in the first place. Despite having a significantly negative impact on my enjoyment of the film, the ending does work quite well and compensates for my problem with the said character. Kelly Marie Tran lends her voice to Raya, a protagonist easy to root for due to her clear motivations and important mission, while Awkwafina is very funny as Sisu, a goofy dragon with more depth than what the viewers might expect from the first impression. Everyone in the cast delivers extraordinary voice work, and every character has some sort of captivating trait that makes the audience support them, except for you know who. Having in mind that kids are indeed the target audience, I’m positive all will feel delighted with this movie. Boasting a predominantly Asian American cast, all delivering exceptional voice work, Raya and the Last Dragon follows a partially disappointing, formulaic narrative but compensates it with stunning animation, a chill-inducing score, and quite a nice ending. Walt Disney Animation Studios returns with an original story that lacks surprising elements, lending all the creativity and imagination to its entertaining, fast-paced adventure packed with undeniably impactful visuals and incredibly riveting action sequences. Despite a significant problem with an inconsistent character that profoundly affects my enjoyment of the film, all other characters are extremely likable, goofy, and well-written. A delightful message about trust and treating others kindly is ultimately well-transmitted to the viewers, which I hope parents will show their kids.

A sacred relic that the Dragons used to Defeat the Druun has given her kingdom prosperity but the surrounding kingdoms all named after various parts of a Dragon are envious of their position. When Raya’s father Chief Benja (Daniel Dae Kim); attempts to unite the other kingdoms, a tragic betrayal results in the relic becoming fractured with each kingdom taking a fragment. As if this situation was not bad enough; the fracturing of the relic ushers in the return of the Druun and they quickly resume turning everything not protected by a barrier of water to stone. The story then jumps years into the future where Raya and her faithful companion Tuk Tuk (Alan TudyK) are searching the rivers of the kingdoms in an effort to find the location where the last Dragon Sisu (Awkwafina) is rumored to have been sleeping for 500 years. Raya is eventually able to locate Sisu who is a very playful and animated creature and the two set off to save the day by obtaining the missing fragments through any means necessary.

This magical fantasy / adventure tale features inspired characters, beautiful animation, and a culturally accurate representation of Asian mythology. It’s a terrific movie on all levels. Long ago in the make-believe world of Kumandra, humans and dragons lived together in harmony. There was a complete balance to the world until an evil force known as the Druun began to threaten the land. This sinister tribe of shadow monsters rose to power by feeding off the discord of humans, and the dragons decided to sacrifice themselves to save all of humanity. New unrest nearly 500 years later has resulted in the five divided lands of the kingdom refusing to co-exist in peace, giving rise to the Druun once again. Determined to preserve the world she loves, lone warrior Raya (voiced by Kelly Marie Tran) decides to track down the last living dragon and use its magic to save Kumandra. Raya is a trailblazing heroine, and she’s one that’s easy to admire and love. Her determination never falters as she learns the value of teamwork and trust along her journey. The film’s main characters are all female, from the last dragon Sisu (voiced by Awkwafina) to Raya’s adversary Namaari (voiced by Gemma Chan). There’s a magical relationship between Sisu and Raya, two unlikely friends that discover in each other that exactly little spark that each of their lives were missing. Even better, Raya collects a group of misfits along her journey, reinforcing the idea that heroes can come from the most unlikely places. The film’s group of directors (Don Hall, Carlos López Estrada, Paul Briggs, and John Ripa) has created original characters that are unlike others you’ve seen before, and the beautiful animation brings them to life. Sisu is a gorgeous pastel-hued dragon with a personality to match (Awkwafina is the MVP in the cast). Raya is a new kind of Disney “princess,” one who knows how to take charge and can kick butt. There’s so much for everyone to love here, even if some of the goofier gags (like a thieving baby who is far more irritating than cute) may take viewers out of the overall experience. The story is exciting and the elements of mythical adventure are spirited, making “Raya and the Last Dragon” one of the more interesting films to come out of Disney in a while.

With inspirational dramas like this I naturally ask myself if I was inspired, and the answer is very much so. Also, did the drama pull me into the lives of the characters and make me forget that I was watching a movie? Yes. The movie effectively addresses real life issues that real families have to deal with and overcome. I could relate to several of the situations. The movie\'s similar in ways to 2010\'s underrated ""Cutback"" (see my review), but made with a bigger budget and is therefore all-around more polished. ""War Room"" is just a great drama and inspiring to boot. It overtly talks about God and prayer in a Christian context, so if that offends you you\'ll probably want to give it a pass. It goes without saying that topics like this are difficult to pull off realistically and un-awkwardly in cinema, but ""War Room"" impressively pulls it off.

An adaptation of a short story by Vladimir Bogomolov set in World War\xa0II, its protagonist is a 12-year-old orphan (Nikolai Burlyaev) on the Eastern Front whose small size allows him to scout German positions undetected. Ivan\'s missions have been useful to the army, but officers Lt. Col. Gryaznov (Nikolai Grinko), Capt. Kholin (Valentin Zubkov) and Lt. Galtsev (Evgeny Zharikov) would like very much to send him to a military academy to get him away from the front, especially as the final offensive against the Germans is imminent. The action in the film plays out between two of Ivan\'s ventures across the river Dniepr into German-held territory. It depicts the difficult life of the soldiers at the front and the destruction that war brought to the Soviet village whose damaged buildings now host the army. Ivan\'s back story is revealed elliptically through comments among the soldiers, dream sequences or flashbacks. A subplot involves Kholin\'s disturbing attempts to seduce Nurse Masha (Valentina Malyavina) and, in stark contrast to earlier Soviet treatments of the war, suggest that in wartime one\'s own fellow soldiers can just as dangerous as the enemy. As far as Tarkovsky films go, Ivan’s Childhood is still an immature work. You\'ll find nothing of the slow, almost ritualistic pacing that marks his later films, and this comes in at a compact 90 minutes. Still, a few shots (tracking shots of a wall, Ivan flipping through a book of religious art) seem like mature Tarkovsky in embryo, and the prominent use of religious iconography (crosses, fresco) is already here. Vadim Yusov\'s cinematography is memorable, with its several ""layers"" of view in certain shots, and the prominent framing of shots with broken timber beams that seem to hinder the characters. I was however very disappointed that at the end, the film segues into basically a Soviet anti-German propaganda film, complete with archival footage of the Soviet capture of Berlin.

Steve McQueen plays Henri, nicknamed Papillon (aka ‘Butterfly’ due to his chest tattoo), while Dustin Hoffman plays his friend Louis Dega. ""Papillon"" (1973) is a realistic ‘prison film’ and probably more accurate than Charrière’s account based on his memory, which was told to a professional writer some three decades after the events. Keep in mind that Charrière had a reputation for being a great storyteller and the authenticity of a lot of the 560-page book has been seriously challenged. The movie only offers the gist of the real-life account and no doubt got it more accurate. Whilst cinephiles generally praise the movie other respectable people criticize it, suggesting that the viewer hopes Papillon will escape so that the film will end (lol). I suspect this is mainly due to the long solitary confinement sequences in the first half, which definitely help the viewer grasp what a living hell it would be. Speaking of which, Charrière never said in his account that he ate bugs in solitary confinement or was in total darkness. The second half is thankfully more adventuresome so, if the miserable solitary confinement sequences tempt you to quit watching, hang in there. There are similarities to McQueen’s earlier “Nevada Smith” (1966), which has a more compelling story. The film runs 2 hours, 31 minutes, and was shot at various locations in Spain and Jamaica. For instance, the penal colony scenes were filmed in Falmouth, Jamaica. Meanwhile Steve McQueen’s famous cliff-jumping stunt near the end actually took place at cliffs in Maui, Hawaii.

This is a work that almost everyone remembers if the theme is films about the prison environment. It's a classic that takes us to a universe of pain, suffering, deprivation and fight against oppression, solidly based on a somewhat autobiographical book by Henri Charriere, called Papillon, a Frenchman who was imprisoned for decades in the penal colony of French Guiana and wrote a book that should be a memoir, but is so full of inventions that it deserves to be considered fiction inspired by real bases. Of course, the issue doesn't matter much to the film: let's forget the man and focus on the character, his alter-ego. Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and released in 1973, it was filmed in Spain and Hawaii. And taking into account that the real prison was abandoned, a faithful setting was created in Jamaica, with some shots filmed in the real location appearing in the end credits. An interesting note: needing a tropical filming location, the production thought it was a good idea to go to a poor country, famous for its soft drugs, in the 1970s. It is, therefore, not surprising that works in Jamaica were marred by robberies and plunder, and by an extraordinary abundance of good marijuana. In addition to the good design of sets, costumes and props, and an inspired and elegant cinematography, the film has a very well done soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith, which is worth listening to and appreciating in itself. With almost two and a half hours in length, the film focuses on portraying the poor conditions of that huge penal colony, and the mistreatment to which the inmates were subjected. I think this contributed greatly to the film's success at the box office: in the aftermath of recent protests, May '68, the Sexual Revolution and peace movements, a film where a single and persistent man faces an entire system of oppression and violence is doomed to success. Specialized critics, however, were not at all convinced, and made harsh comments about the film. Shortly afterwards, at the bizarre 1974 Oscar ceremony, the film was largely ignored, losing the only award for which it had been nominated (Best Dramatic Original Score). But considering the way it has persisted, stood the test of time and remained popular, perhaps the critics and Oscar judges were all wrong. However, the success of this film cannot be attributed solely to a good story released at a propitious time, and convincingly told and acted. Steve McQueen is a key part of this success, thanks to an incredible dramatic interpretation, one of the best in his artistic career. The actor manages to express, in his face and mannerisms, the pain and tenacity of the character he embodies, and commits himself entirely to what he is doing. Next to him was also Dustin Hoffman, in a very interesting and elegant work that the actor fully responded to. On a much lower level, the film has positive contributions from Woodrow Parfrey, Don Gordon, Ratna Assan and Val Avery."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}]",100,Yes!

He observes a little boy running between the two homes and then entering one. The little boy is unceremoniously ejected from the home by two non-white men with pistols. You can tell that they are bad men because they shoot bullets next to the boy in order to scare him. A young woman, perhaps the boy\'s mother, looks on anxiously. The little boy runs to the other house and calls out ""Papa!"" to the man who comes out of that house. The bad men then proceed to physically assault the father. The bad men observe the lone white man but ignore him. The lone white man makes eye contact with the young woman and gives a gentle smile to her, without opening his lips. She slams her wooden window shut, which has bars in front of it. He moves on to some other place. Next stop for our lone rider is a town. He is approached by the town\'s bell ringer, who informs him ""everybody here has become very rich or else they are dead...You will get rich here or you\'ll be killed"". This he says after helpfully mentioning (to both the viewer and the unnamed white man) a couple of important surnames in this town, Rojo and Baxter. As the lone rider proceeds down the dirt street in the town, the residents in their homes peek anxiously through their curtains to watch him. It\'s a town in fear. Next in the street are some white looking men (their accents would suggest a different ethnicity but that\'s probably just dubbing, perhaps?) armed with pistols who proceed to fire bullets next to his horse in order to run him out of town. However, our protagonist decides to \'hang around\', so to speak, in one of a few comical moments in this film. Needing much more exposition, we are introduced to the owner of the town\'s cantina. Again, names aren\'t really used in this film. The cantina owner asks our protagonist what he wants in this town. ""Food and something to drink"" he says, to which the cantina owner replies ""Eating and drinking and killing. That\'s all you can do, just like the rest of your kind"". They\'ve only just met and already with the assumptions! He goes on to say: ""if you don\'t mind doing a little killing, you will have no trouble finding someone eager to pay you"". Later in the conversation we finally learn of the town\'s name from the cantina owner. It\'s San Miguel. Maybe it\'s a fictional town but the Wikipedia entry for this film says that in the film, it\'s on the border of Mexico and the US. When the lone rider says to the cantina owner ""Any town that sells guns and liquor has gotta be a rich one"" we get the big dose of juicy exposition needed from the cantina owner, who informs us that ""Not the town, only those who buy and sell, and the bosses are the ones who clean up...but when there are two around, then I\'d say that there is one too many"". This brings us back to the names mentioned by the town\'s bell ringer: Rojo and Baxter. Our well of exposition, the cantina owner, says: ""The Rojos boys, three brothers who sell liquor. And then there\'s the Baxters, big gun merchants. If I\'m not mistaken, you already met Baxter\'s gang, didn\'t you?"". After referring to our protagonist\'s horse as a ""mule"", the cantina owner learns that our interloper sees his position thus: ""Me right in the middle"". Cantina owner: ""Where you do what?"". Interloper: ""Crazy bell ringer was right. There\'s money to be made in a place like this"". This said after the cantina owner has told him of the two gangs that ""They\'ve enlisted all the scum that hangs around both sides of the frontier, and they pay in dollars"". That\'s pretty much as much of the plot that I want to tell you. Much later in the film, the coffin maker/undertaker refers to our protagonist as ""Joe"". It struck me that either the undertaker just called him that or our protagonist did tell him his real name...or just created one to tell the undertaker. Anyway, ""Joe"" asks the cantina owner which of the two gangs is the stronger then soon after bumps into the head of the Baxter gang, John Baxter, who is, ironically...the town\'s sheriff! How will all this play out? Watch the film to find out, obviously...but maybe the cantina owner was perceptive, because later on in the film, ""Joe"" informs him that ""The dead can be very useful sometimes. They\'ve helped me out of tough spots more than once"". Hmm. What on Earth? Despite being a mysterious figure, ""Joe"" does reveal some titbits about himself (perhaps), which might explain his character or why he does things. On one occasion he says ""I never found home that great"" and on another occasion, when asked why he would help a woman, he responds ""Why? I knew someone like you once. There was no one there to help"". Random observations: ^ I did have a preconception that the protagonist of this film would be a godlike figure and that is sort of confirmed in the film. At one point ""Joe"" says (on the 1st floor balcony of the cantina) ""Things always look different from higher up"". Ramón Rojo at another point says ""I don\'t like that Americano. He\'s too smart to be just a hired fighter"". ^ The version of this film which I watched was screened on SBS World Movies in Australia, on 09/10/2024, at 9:30pm and I watched it over two days from 09/11/2024...because the lack of subtitles meant that I had to grind through the film, replaying bits to work out what was being said, or reading an online transcript. That was really disappointing and in other circumstances I would have deleted the film without watching it but I persevered and did find it rewarding for it\'s narrative engagement. After removing the ads, the length of the film was about 1:35:48 long, from the start of the MGM lion\'s raw at the beginning to its end at the end. The four lots of ads had a sum total of 16 minutes and 26 seconds. ^ SBS had a rating of the film of MA15+ which I didn\'t feel was justified for the most part. To explain that, there\'s a scene where the cantina owner says to ""Joe"" the following: ""It\'s like playing cowboys and Indians"". That comment struck me as being a bit meta. As a film made in 1964, maybe it was violent for its time but now? There was no realism to the gun violence. There was no blood, really. It was really only for the fist fight that the no doubt primitive make-up got quite gruesome and warranted such a rating. It\'s the art of this film that even though the physical violence isn\'t particularly realistic and the blood looks fake (more like paint), the scene evokes gruelling punishment. ^ It\'s not clear to me that the director of the film, Sergio Leone, has done anything other than re-present America back to itself in a way which accords with its own self-perception. There are mere glimpses of a story which would deconstruct that self-mythologising...the cantina owner on who visits San Miguel: ""Bandits and smugglers. They come down from Texas. They cross the frontier to stock up on guns and liquor. The cost is much less here.

Now, my history isn\'t the best but...\'Mexico\'s\' gold? Yes, we have here a case of a tale of two colonising societies and only allusions to the victims of that. ^ There is an ecstatic element to the bloodlust of the Mexicans towards the end of the film. ^ Even though this film was, in a way, ""playing cowboys and Indians"", I really enjoyed the engaging narrative. Whilst the lead up to the resolution of the conflict wasn\'t logical, it charmed me with its mythic quality...a quality that Americans would, no doubt, love to see about themselves. ^ In what seems like a continuity error, the bullet holes in the poncho don\'t match to what was underneath...I happened to pause my PVR at this point, randomly, so I just followed through with that. ^ There are only credits at the start of the film. There is something akin to the James Bond gun barrel sequence in the animated opening sequence. I wondered if Ennio Morricone wrote the score...it sounded a bit like him. The credits list Dan Savio as the composer but luckily Wikipedia lists Ennio Morricone as the real name of the composer. A part of his score at the start of the film reminded me of something...maybe it was ""When Johnny comes marching home""...or maybe it wasn\'t. There is some vocalisation in the score and it seemed to me as if the words were ""We can fight!"" but maybe there were no actual words used. ^ If Clint Eastwood has ever had the nickname ""Squint"", then a scene about 53:19 minutes in would be a good example of why that was the case. When did he first start squinting? On television first? ^ The scene with the armoured suit made me think it would be relevant at a later point...it didn\'t in a way that they thought that it might. In any case, there are some nice callbacks in the dialogue to other events in the film. ^ I was thinking of giving this film 7 stars out of 10 on this site with an actual score of 75% (I round down the stars on this site) but the storytelling was so engaging and the mythic elements pleasing enough for me to bump up my score despite the inexplicable lack of subtitles for this broadcast affecting how I consumed this film.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Action', 46), ('Adventure', 41), ('Science Fiction', 30), ('Drama', 29), ('Other', 116)]}]",100,Yes!

I know; one of those things isn’t like the others. The filmmakers, however, put the motorcycle fetish to good use, infusing it with imagery that’s almost religious in order to reveal its real-world impracticality. Mouse (Jahi Di'Allo Winston) is a bright 14-year-old boy with a natural affinity for and encyclopedic knowledge of animals that make him a natural-born veterinarian — if he lives long enough to become one. His late older brother Stro (Tyquan Ford), whom Mouse idolized, has become the patron saint of Mouse's adoration of bikes; whenever he speaks about them, Mouse is overwhelmed with a kind of ecstatic, frantic fervor. Meanwhile, gangbanger Blax (Meek Mill) and detective Rivers (Will Catlett) butt heads over Mouse’s future. It’s worth noting that this conflict is not distilled into a black-and-white morality, and the two men strike an unexpected deal to ensure Mouse gets a second chance. The film has been skillfully staged, photographed and edited (Katelin Arizmendi’s cinematography in particular provides us with a vivid experience of the Baltimore summer streets) — perhaps a little too much so; there’s a high speed chase that ironically seems to glorify exactly the sort of behavior that the movie as a whole condemns. Cutting this sequence would have solved another pressing issue: that of the excessive running time. I’m splitting hairs, though; unlike most movies about motorized criminals (like Fast and Furious, to mention one other than Torque), Charm City Kings knows that actions have consequences; can't live life in the fast lane very long without crashing sooner or later. The film is also aware that cycles must be broken for things to change. Mouse goes down the same path as his brother, never stopping to think that he could end up the same way; on the contrary, he is convinced that for some reason he is different, special — and he is, or rather, he could be, if he really wanted to. I'm always complaining about kids acting like adults in movies for no other reason than that it's 'cute.' Here, though, Winston acts not like an adult but like a child doing his best to appear older than his age to fit in with the group he wants to be a part of. Fittingly, his performance isn't resolute and steady but tentative and uncertain, and that's the perfect note for the character (Blax even warns him that a real man doesn't stutter or look down, failing to realize at the time that Mouse remains, despite his bravado, a kid who has no idea what he's getting himself into). This is a great performance from Winston as a kid who, on streets where children must often grow too fast for their own good, wants to be the first to cross the finish line."", 'most_watched_genres': []}]",100,Yes!

In every scene and interaction this regret is worn by Charlie as a cloak of his past that will stay with him until his dying breath. This character is an immense undertaking and Brendon Fraser plays him perfectly. The emotion he delivers is palpable, which lends itself so seamlessly to scenes of raw sadness and despair. Not only is Fraser a highlight, but the entire supporting cast does an excellent job. Hong Chau is superb, and despite her tough, no nonsense, science focused exterior hides a deep and genuine connection with Charlie. She is incredibly hurt by the way he is treating his body, but is defenseless to his desires, resulting in her to continually feed his addiction. It is a brutal back and forth that is tackled with immense care. Sadie Sink is great as well, she is delivers a brutal performance that leaves the character of Ellie easily hatable with very little redeemable qualities. I understand that this was the point of her character, and by no means is this a knock on Sink's performance, but it felt like a bit much. She was too cruel, to the point of unbelievability, which took a bit away from the message that was trying to be delivered. The pace was a bit slow for my liking. I felt as if the Thomas subplot was a bit pointless and could have been cut from the movie with no ill effects.

Here his is the critically obese ""Charlie"" who has grown to a size where his health is in tatters and he has virtually no mobility as he regularly consumes two large pizzas for dinner and two great meatball subs for lunch. We learn quite quickly a little of what initially drove this man to this level of despair and as things begin to look terminal, we share his aspirations to reconcile with his daughter whom he left eight years earlier to be with his gay lover ""Allan"". Now for all I thought Fraser was superb in this film, I found Sadie Sink\'s performance as the truly selfish, conniving and odious daughter ""Ellie"" (upon whom he rather dotes) stole this for me. At times I really did want to shoot her! Ty Simpkins also does well as the well meaning god-squadder who finds his association with this dysfunctional family helps open his eyes too. Hong Chau performs well as his long suffering friend/nurse/confidante ""Liz"", and as mortality looms the characters are drawn into an increasingly angry, hostile environment that is full of bitterness, rancour and regret certainly, but maybe - just maybe - the slightest hint of reconciliation. Fraser will never deliver another performance like this again. Sure, his size and generally slothful demeanour are so far from the hale-fellow-well-met series of characters we have seen thus far in his career that they are bound to have an effect. His acting, though, is honest and emotional. His character is torn and distraught and he conveys that potently, especially in the scenes with his obnoxious daughter. The plot has an inevitability to it, which doesn\'t usually work so well for me - but here, it helps focus on the few interlinked stories and characters allowing little room for distraction.

The finale is grossly manipulative, corny, excessive, and if what came before wasn’t so great, it would diminish director Darren Aronofsky’s entire project. Thanks to a heartbreaking script (from writer Samuel D. Hunter) and a once-in-a-lifetime lead performance from Brendan Fraser, it takes little effort to overlook the film’s more negative aspects. Based on Hunter’s 2012 play of the same name, the psychological drama tells the story of Charlie (Fraser), a reclusive English professor who is living with severe obesity. Weighing over 600 pounds and unable to leave his home, Charlie spends his days alone in his small, dingy apartment with intermittent visits from his friend and nurse Liz (Hong Chau), who is his only companion. It’s been an interesting week for the man, as he’s had two additional unexpected visitors: a religious missionary (Ty Simpkins) who is compelled to continue his visits, and Charlie’s estranged and hostile teenager daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink). With his health in grave decline (he repeatedly refuses to seek care at a hospital), Charlie decides to do everything in his power to gain one last chance at redemption in his daughter’s eyes, and every ounce of time he has left is spent reconnecting with her. The film takes place in a confined space, and the lead character spends the majority of his time sitting on a sofa. This cramped setting feels suffocating, which in turn conveys the feelings that Charlie is also experiencing. This is a story about empathy, and it’s admittedly challenging at first glance to feel a ton of compassion for Charlie no matter how accepting you may think you are or claim to be. His outward appearance is shocking and repellant, and it’s part of human nature to look at him as if he were a freak show attraction. What’s interesting about the film is that it digs deeper beneath Charlie’s obesity and lets you into his heart. I was surprised to find by the end of the story just how much I had grown to care so deeply for him. Folks who have seen the film and are crying that it is “fat shaming” are missing the point. This isn’t a story about humiliation or degradation, it’s a film about actually seeing the person inside a repulsive exterior and giving them humanity. This is not a project that mocks obesity, as has so often (and sadly) been the case with many Hollywood films. This is a story with substantial and challenging themes about depression, mental illness, and addiction. In this case, Charlie has spent years self-medicating his despair and unhappiness with food, and is now suffering from an eating disorder that has raged out of control. None of this would be so emotionally touching if not for Fraser’s lead performance. He is impressive and outstanding as Charlie, and it’s one of the greatest cinematic performances in years (and definitely of the actor’s career). It’s not the spectacle of the makeup or fat suit that makes him memorable: it’s how Fraser thoroughly embodies Charlie with a deep, soulful pain in his eyes. His performance absolutely ripped my heart right out of my chest to the point where I found it difficult to breathe. He’sthatgood. While there’s been so much talk about Fraser, Chau’s performance is equally heartbreaking. Through her facial expressions and body language, you can see and feel the pain Charlie is causing Liz. Everyone is simply waiting for the man to die, and you’re right there by Liz’s side as she cares for her best friend in a final act of selfless affection. It’s an agonizing thing to watch and experience, and Chau conveys her torment in an understated, poignant way. If it sounds like this is a tough film to watch, I will assure you that it is. You won’t leave the theater floating on air when it’s over. This is an adult drama that will leave you in tears with its story of resentment, vulnerability, regret, and humanity.

And there is perhaps no more quirky Ghibli film thanKiki\'s Delivery Service. Fundamentally,Kiki\'s Delivery Serviceis a coming of age film, telling the story of 13-year-old trainee witch Kiki who leaves home with her cat Jiji to continue her training. Arriving in a far-off European city, Kiki starts a flying delivery business, couriering goods around the town, which catches the eye of aviation-obsessed Tombo, who is immediately smitten by her flying. One of the big draws of Ghibli is the simplicity of the stories, making them hugely accessible for the audience. In Kiki\'s Delivery Service we must just accept that there are ""some"" witches and even though people will possibly never see one, they are not feared. In fact, the only fear in Kiki\'s Delivery Service comes from Kiki\'s own self-doubt. Considering, then, that Japan is far more conservative than the West - especially when it comes to family values - it is quite bizarre that one conservative Christian group in America took the decision to boycott the film solely for the purpose of glamorising witches. But really, Kiki being a witch is completely secondary to the film. In some ways it could be argued that Kiki being a witch is simply another excuse for director Hayao Miyazaki to view another Ghibli world from the sky, allowing his team of animators to draw some of the most beautiful landscapes in animation. In addition, it allows Kiki\'s comic foil to be a talking cat (who, in the English dub, is voiced by the instantly vocally recognisable Phil Hartman, who you may remember from such shows asThe Simpsons, where he plays Troy McClure). As well as dominating most of the film\'s funnier moments, Jiji also depicts Kiki\'s transition from innocence. Despite all of this marshmallowy innocence,Kiki\'s Delivery Serviceis still a quirk. The plot is littered with unanswered questions - what happened to the other flying witch who was returning home? - and the final act involving the dirigible is, frankly, too overdramatic and out-of-place with the rest of the down-to-earth storyline. Still, it is perfectly enjoyable, and while it isn\'t necessarily the first Ghibli I would recommend, it is still one that you should see.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 13), ('Comedy', 5), ('Romance', 5), ('History', 4), ('Other', 14)]}]",100,Yes!

It features great locations shot with great cinematography, but that’s about all director D.J. Caruso can do to entice us to keep watching. It’s terrific to see a story unfolding in a non-CGI, true-to-life setting, even if it’s Cape Town standing in for California (but then some of the greatest westerns were filmed in Europe, so there’s that), but while this movie arguably achieves the western look, it fails to conjure up any sort of western feel. The script concerns a Hooker with a Heart of Gold known as Angel, who is so sought after that the local Madame, who calls herself Duchess, holds a daily raffle to determine which lucky slack-jawed gold miners – there is more than one winner per day – get to hold sexual congress with her. This is such a cumbersome arrangement that it actually gets in the way of the plot, so that co-writers Francine Rivers and Caruso Hand Wave it not long after they have introduced it. So-called “dirt farmer” Michael Hosea becomes smitten with Angel, so what does he do to get near her? Does he buy all the numbers in the raffle? Does he have the raffle rigged? No and no; he simply “pays double”. That’s it. Why this hasn’t occurred to at least some of the yokels who form a daily scrum outside the brothel is anybody’s guess. Another good question is where Michael, who is not a miner, finds enough “gold dust” to gain access to Angel on three different occasions. Angel wants nothing to do with Michael owing to a deep-seated hatred and distrust of men, which is established in a series of flashbacks that are so many and so long they could make up an entire, separate movie all by themselves. They are also the reason that Redeeming Love unnecessarily breaks the 120-minute mark. But the oddest part about these flashbacks is that they show Angel escaping a life of compulsory whoredom only to enter a life of voluntary whoredom. Twice. Maybe even thrice, but that last time is once again against her will. In any case, it gets to be quite repetitive after a while. It is only after Angel gets the tar beaten out of her by the Duchess’s lackey Magowan that she relents and agrees to marry Michael – but first he has to pay off her “debt” to the Duchess, and the irony that he literally buys Angel off in order to make an honest woman out of her is lost on Michael and Caruso alike. Redeeming Love’s greatest achievement, other than its photography, is how well it masks its biblical pedigree. According to Wikipedia this is a “Christian Western” based on an homonymous novel by Rivers (unread by me, though it wouldn’t surprise if she had first published it under the pseudonym F.R. Ancine), which in turn is inspired by an obscure Old Testament book – not that you would even guess at any of this by watching the movie, and that’s actually a good thing.

Stephen Merchant takes over the role of Caliban from Tómas Lemarquis, who played the character in X-Men Apocalypse, and transforms him into an ally to Logan and Charlies. Merchant is quite good in the role. But what really dragged down the movie is its nihilism. The other X-Men are completely missing from the film and mutants have been wiped out almost completely. A sense of doom and hopelessness looms over the film. This movie completely upends the warm and hopeful epilogue of Days of Future Past, where the X-Men were restored to life and glory and mutants weren't extinct after all. Death seems to stalk Logan and Charles wherever they go. There is also a conspicuous lack of significant female characters in this movie, too. The only female of note is Laura/ X-23, and she spends most of the film mute. There is also a complete lack of any strong or memorable villains.

If, as expected (and surely to god it\'s hoped so), this is the last we see of the grumpy metal clawed superhero, then what a fitting and triumphant bow out it is. James Mangold, the director, has managed to create an adult superhero movie without it really being a superhero pic, for he has created a film noir Western that happens to be about a superhero. Mangold\'s love of noir and Westerns bursts from the screen, which for those who follow those wonderful stands of cinema, will come as no surprise having seen with notice his Copland and 3:10 To Yuma redux. There\'s a perpetual grimness to the narrative that belies the quite often stunning surrounding locales, heavy themes such as men out of time - with destinies written (cue a deft comic book movie within a comic book chunk of metaphysics) - surrogates, mental illness, human ignorance, and on it goes, the narrative strong on intelligence as much as it is in wrought emotion. Western fans will also be buoyed by the part that the 1953 classic Western Shane has to play in things, considerably so as its importance narratively, orally and visually is mightily strong. Logan\'s Run! Ah yes, well being ""adult"" is all well and good, but is Logan thrilling? Do we get pumped up Wolverine action, blood brains, splatter and mucho muscle flexing and pained roars of anger? Oh yes! Action from the off is never far away, and wonderfully staged and choreographed it is. Lots of memorable set-pieces, while also some cleverly constructed sequences such as Xavier\'s mind seizures hold court and enthral. Yet the kicker with all that is we are clued in to the emotional baggage that the side-burn sporting protag carries with him. With each fight we sense the bigger picture, even as we watch in awe the emergence of Laura (ironic film noir name right there as it happens) - and her part in this very ""human"" story - the thrills and spills are propelled by a meaningful but battered heart. Tech credits are superb. Acting honours go to Jackman, who after giving 17 years of his life to the character, gives it his all and this multi faceted performance, in a perfect world, deserves Oscar recognition. Patrick Stewart, also, is immense, playing the nonagenarian Charles Xavier with such class, gracefulness and storming emotion that one can only admire. Film debutante Dafne Keen as Laura is utterly engrossing, quite a debut indeed, whilst Stephen Merchant as albino mutant tracker Caliban is effective to the point we hanker for more. Although the villains fronted by Boyd Holbrook (rote henchman leader) and Richard E. Grant (smarmy scientist git) just about pass muster, there\'s nothing to damage the piece. Cinematography (John Mathieson) is ""A"" grade, the filters set on neo-noir, with the splendid film noir black and white version a fillip for the heart of noir lovers. All that is left is for the sound mix to boom and the director to steer with heart, brain and soul, without doubt both come up trumps. One of 2017s best films, a genre splicer that ticks all the boxes of great film making. 10/10', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 43), ('Thriller', 42), ('Crime', 34), ('Action', 29), ('Other', 111)]}, {'writer': 'Reno', 'score': '70%', 'review': ""A farewell and a welcome!

If you are into tragic drama and do not mind the super hero twist of the movie then this is a movie for you. The technical qualities is why this movie gets any stars at all from me. If I would judge it by story only then it would have gotten zero, null, nada, nicths, rien, ingenting. For me it was depressing, boring and not at all fun to watch. The only reason I watched it is because I, as a X-Men fan, simply had to watch it as well as having it in my collection but I would have been happier it this movie had never been made. Wolverine is more or less an unpleasant drinking bum clad in filthy ragged clothes. Professor X is half insane and apparently dangerous to himself and the people around him. We get absolutely no explanation as to how this sad state of affairs. The entire movie is dark in spirit with the X-Men all but died out and Wolverine and Professor X just waiting to die. Then in comes this female child who later turns out to be a female version of Wolverine. She pretty much lacks any form of charisma and she and Wolverine spends almost the entire time in a state of conflict, much due to Wolverine who seems to think everyone should go fuck themselves so that he can continue to self destruct. The bad guys are the usual evil corporation doing experiments on X-Men, genetics etc. Supposedly they were behind the almost extermination of X-Men but of course they keep their own little army of “enhanced” humans that doggedly harasses Wolverine & Co. There are some nice action sequences but there is really no good overall boss. No one with enough Charisma to take the role of the main adversary unless you count X-24 who only took part in a few parts of the movie. By the way, why the fuck do Wolverine, Laura as well as X-24 have to grunt like horny monkeys when they fight? The story is rather predictable with no major surprises, little depth and low on logic. A typical Hollywood drama. Not really anything to write home about. The movie is just so depressing from start to finish. As a last farewell to Wolverine and Professor X it is almost insulting.

Clearly this cover-up resonates throughout the US a great deal, but living in England for most of my life I don\'t think the shocking revelations ever rang out much other than for a random story-line that probably got buried after the immediate events of 9/11. I won\'t repeat the story here because other reviewers have already covered that; but what I really admired about the film was how very underplayed it felt throughout. The pacing, the somber soundtrack, the unhurried editing, even the narration all helped capture the suffocating mood of the story as it unraveled in shocking detail. There was no histrionics that you sometimes get with films that are about to expose something deeply shocking. I am reminded of films such as ""The Insider"" and ""All the President\'s Men"" where the the lives of the investigators/victims/whistle-blowers are put into immediate danger by a ""dark force"" should they expose their findings to the public. But with Spotlight, such things were avoided. Instead everything was kept at a ""civil"" level between The Boston Globe and The Church, even though you could feel an underlying dread or threat simmering throughout. I particularly liked the ending because even though the story was published and the victims finally came forward before the credits rolled, there was no big fanfare declaring how wonderful the Spotlight team were in exposing this evil. Instead it left us with a reminder that the abuse of children by the RC church was (and probably still is) a world-wide problem; not helped when you learn that Cardinal Law was never arrested, but was later reassigned to a high ranking position in the Vatican, even though both he and the Vatican itself was perfectly aware of the crimes committed by the Church against innocent boys and girls.', 'most_watched_genres': []}]",100,Yes!

The film tells the story of the fairly turbulent rise of this ""Take That"" singer from boyhood exponent of Gilbert and Sullivan to a man on the right end of an £80 millions record deal. His dad (Steve Pemberton) went off to a football match whilst he was a child and never came back, and that left him with his mum ""Janet"" (Kate Mulvany) and adoring nan (Alison Steadman) living a pretty much hand to mouth existence and leaving him with a pretty solid foundation for his later emotional and trust issues. Unless you\'ve lived on the moon these last twenty years, then you\'ll know much of what happens next. What does make this stand out a little more is the fact that Williams himself is behind the project and is in no way afraid to portray himself as a complete ass. His drink, drugs, tantrums and generally spoilt brattishness are laid bare with little, if any, attempt to sanitise. In some ways it reminded me of the recent ""Amy"" biopic and came hot on the heels of a recent viewing of ""Easter Parade"" (1948) with both serving, for completely different reasons, to augment the thrust of this story of a person who attained great stardom, success and wealth - and ultimately ended up with addictions galore and few, real, friends amidst a sea of hangers-on and parasites all too eager to selfishly cash in on the fame of a lad who started aged just fifteen. Of course it\'s not exactly balanced, and I\'m sure the gospel according to Robbie might not be quite how others see their own behaviour (or his) but there is an honesty to this that brings home just how ruthless the music business is and at just how fickle fame can be when those we idolise lose their lustre. It doesn\'t do it any harm that many of his solo songs work well through big screen audio with some classy string arrangements and powerful vocals to remind us that, unlike many of the largely forgotten ""Take That"" singles, his music - especially the stuff he made with Guy Chambers - is the stuff we will really long remember.

Filmed by Howard Hawks as a response to what he saw as none macho cinema in Gary Cooper's acclaimed High Noon, Rio Bravo has moments of brilliance that are sadly coupled with failings that are not Hawksian peccadilloes. The macho plot is simple but wholly effective as our heavily out numbered heroes (John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan & Ricky Nelson) defend a jail house against a marauding mob trying to release an incarcerated friend. This alone sounds grand but the truth is, is that it takes the film nigh on close to 100 minutes to get to the adrenalin rush of the siege and even allowing for fine character development, the film is ponderous and even at times dangerously close to being self indulgent. The casting of Ricky Nelson was (as is widely regarded now) one of the worst of its kind in the history of cinema, he was there purely as a marketing ploy to garner the teen audience who were bopping to his pop tunes way back then. In fairness to Hawks, though, he saw straight away that this was out of Nelson's league and promptly (and cutely) gave him few lines of note to speak of. Also a big negative in the film is Angie Dickinson as the Female interest, she is raw and fresh out of water, and it shows, just like sushi on your plate. The bonuses with the film however keep the film talked about for ever more, Wayne is magnetic and believable, whilst Martin comes into his own as the drunk trying to do right, a superlative performance from him and one would think that is really down to Hawks' direction.

Snatch seems to be one of those spunky British gangster films that critics are divided on, yet it\'s loved by the target audience.

Where Raimi remade The Evil Dead, and just called it Evil Dead II, Ritchie cheekily tries to get away with remaking Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and calling it Snatch. Sure the circumstances in plotting are different, and there\'s a big American star brought in to beef things up for the global market, but it\'s the same movie and without doubt it\'s lazy film making. But it still - like Evil Dead II - Rocks! Snatch in story terms is concerned with a big diamond that stitches together a number of threads involving the London underworld. Some rough and tough Romany types join in the fun, headed by a purposely illegible Brad Pitt, while Dennis Farina, Benicio Del Toro and Rade Serbedzija add more cosmopolitan meat to the crooks and gangster stew. The British cement holding the building up comes in the twin forms of Jason Statham and Stephen Graham, with Vinnie Jones once again turning up to frighten the masses. Everything from bare knuckle fighting to bumbled robberies - to dog fighting and shifty arcade empires - are here, with Ritchie writing characterisations that positively boom off of the screen. As with ""Lock-Stock"", the beauty is in the way violence and humour are deftly blended. Scenes are often bloody but also bloody funny, a pearl of dialogue is never far away from a perilous situation. The comic tone is more close to the knuckle here, Ritchie having fun toying with ethnic and machismo stereotypes, while he brings his bag of visual tricks before it got boring. The narrative is deliciously complex, but much credit to Ritchie for the way he pulls all the threads neatly together in a whirl of scene splicing and cocky literary assuredness.

Best screenplay suggests best story, best plot, best characters and dialogue; best combination of drama, comedy, intrigue, emotional engagement, suspense, social and political relevance; one peppered with casual everydayisms, baited with humour and simmering with intelligence, threatening to release an experiential payload of euphoric proportions; a work that can transcend genre and demographics, build up simultaneously on various levels, plumbed by the weight of it\'s essential voice, sending out intuitive signals, rippling with perplexing channels and insightful glimpses that are symbolically blended into plain words on paper; all with a properly superb balance of sex, wit, desire, comfort, fear, anger and wisdom in an accelerated narrative leading us to a magnificent crescendo and--fade out--leaving us to wonder.

As for ill-fated romances, the doomed alliance between old-school journalism (Holden) seduced and corrupted into severing his ties with his compassionate spouse to hastily shack up with the opportunistic post-modern media wench (Dunaway) is fraught with more complications than anythingCasablancacan muster, and it\'s only one of the sub-plots. Of courseNetworkis most famous for the ""I\'m mad as hell"" rant, which swells from a nuanced and complex story arc demonstrating the rise and fall of an iconic media star. Hell-raising public mischief aside, Howard Beale\'s profound narrative leads off with a suicidally desperate, washed-up newsman who impulsively hits a nerve, rockets to stardom as a modern-day prophet, then is shaped and sensationalized as an overcooked parody by the media, stigmatized by maniacal Fox-news-like delusions that overtake him until he gets too big for his britches and needs a walloping corporate scolding, causing his starry streak to fizzle out, before getting gunned down by the greedy TV execs who made him, leaving hapless undiscriminating audiences to grasp for the next new thing. Networkis inspired writing that doesn\'t require heart-throbbing movie stars to pull it off. It could have been directed by my illiterate grandmother, shot on VHS in a dingy church basement, performed by eager boy scouts and girl guides, and it would still be the greatest screenplay of all time, one not just for the spectacle of projecting on a giant screen, but for doubling as a giant mirror with just enough sugar-coated satire to swallow the shitty truth about ourselves. Though calling _Network _a satire is like calling Hamlet a murder mystery. Satire is either spineless and passive-aggressive, or specific and short-lived.

Exerting his ornate insanity upon the entranced viewers who innocently stare at their cubic televisions, watching the news broadcast fuelled by media misrepresentation and propaganda. “Go to your nearest window and scream”, acting as the voice of the working class, benign to the American corporate fundamentals that masquerade the politics of democracy. In an age where leading actors can represent constituencies or states, and businessmen can be presidential candidates for a nation (and successfully winning...), Lumet’s timeless satire on conceptualised democracy is one that grows more appropriate with each passing decade. A statement on the American financial system, where colossal stock markets rule the supposed freedom of the people. Broadcasting networks more focussed on combating against each other for monetary viewership, leading to exaggerated fabrications, rather than reporting the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Exploiting the frail mentality of humanity to feed the greed and lust of “humanoid” managers, capitalising on the naivety of man. Network depicts the modern evolution of communicating false truths. As technology evolves, we grow more and more susceptible to the “truth” that is conveyed to us. We, much like sponges, absorb the information demonstrated through the porous pixels that we subject our eyes to. Televisions. And through hyperbolised satire, including planning an assassination attempt and coercing suicidal tendencies, Lumet offers a cutthroat insight into broadcasting institutions and the meticulous methods in which networks function. Motivated by stock shares and rating dominance. Pioneering the consumption of propagandist material. Lumet exploits the audacious power of televisions and its communicative abilities, turning an often comedic satire into a transcendental horror feature. Powered by sterling performances all-round, including the elusively commanding Dunaway, the maddening lunacy of Finch and the smoothly suave Holden, the poetic dialogue immediately captures the attention of its audience. Concisely elaborate with a hint of existential analysis, an ornate lexicon that refrains viewers from tuning out. Lumet’s long sumptuous takes, allowing the performances to ironically hypnotise, further extend the reach of its material. Superlative direction that, whilst suddenly throws you into the immediate chaos of Beale’s mentality, eases the hectic pace with its scathing power. The offscreen affair between Dunaway and Holden was the only underdeveloped sub-plot, reinforcing her workaholic agenda that likened her to a corporate machine than to a human with emotive capabilities. Aside from that, Network absolutely deserves its near-perfect acclaim. A considerably profound illustration of the American system that tantalisingly exposes the fraudulence of promised conceptualised democracy, whilst also enforcing the relinquishment of humanity through television sets.

The conditions and conditions of the network changed after Beale's decision to commit suicide in front of the camera the next day. The film takes us through the changes that occur to the network after this incident. How did Howard get the situation to the brink, how does the network deal with the crisis, and how do they benefit from the incident, or in a more correct, how do they exploit it to increase the number of views and return the network to the most powerful television network in America. The film focuses on 4 characters, the first character is Diana Christensen, a character who doesn't care about high principles in the media and tries in various ways to do anything, even if it is bad, in order to make the network gain more views, a character that surprises you a lot because of her orientations. The second character is Howard Beale and the internal factors that led him to stand in front of the camera, fragile and mind-bending. Is it personal or is the network related? The third character, who are the members of the network and the fate of the company, what are the things they will do in order to save the network from collapse and raise viewing rates and ratings, even if at the expense of harming others, literally anything? The last character is the viewers. How do they want to attract viewers to the network as long as possible to ensure higher profits and the viewer to stay for as long as possible? This requires many things that you will see in the movie. What I liked about the film is that the film was able to mock companies, criticize societies, and focus on the weakness of people through its story and not through direct messages. The highest number of views. What we see now in the media in the 21st century, we see that this is true, although the film says that it is based on fictional events. How do the minds of the media founders play with the minds of the viewers through the television screens that reach every home? It was formulated well.

Even now, almost fifty years later, it still resonates as conversations about true journalism versus commercial pandering showing no sign of ever abating, let alone finding a solution that adequately satisfies both.

Written by TV pioneer Paddy Chayefsky, this winner of four Oscars on 10 total nominations provides a comical but cynically disturbing look inside the workings of a fictitious American television network. In telling this story, the film eerily forecast the direction this medium would take in the decades that followed with remarkable accuracy, stunningly predicting such developments as the tabloidization of TV, the consolidation of media ownership, the impact of foreign influence and investment, and the dumbing down, sensationalism and line-blurring of its content in both its entertainment and journalistic programming. It also nailed developments outside the television business with great clarity by focusing on the pivotal role that TV played (and would come to play) in those occurrences. And, even though it’s something of a nostalgic time capsule of the period in which it was filmed, the picture has held up remarkably well (it gets better with every viewing for me), even unwittingly providing viewers with an ironic and unsettling metaphor for the ubiquitous rise of social media (with TV serving as a stunningly fitting stand-in). Chayefsky’s Academy Award-winning script is positively brilliant, epitomizing what good screenwriting can (and should) be. And its casting is about as good as it gets, earning Oscars for the performances of Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch and Beatrice Straight, along with well-deserved nominations for William Holden and Ned Beatty and noteworthy accolades for Robert Duvall and Marlene Warfield. In fact, I’m stunned that this offering lost out to “Rocky” for best picture and that nominee Lumet was passed over for the best director award. Those oversights aside, however, I was nevertheless privileged to view this offering at a retrospective screening in honor of the filmmaker’s 100th birthday to a nearly sold-out audience. I’m pleased to see that this celluloid gem still garners so much viewer attention nearly 50 years after its release and that it’s attracting the interest of moviegoers of all ages. This is an absolute must-see for avid cinephiles, as well as highly recommended viewing for anyone who truly wants a poignant, insightful look at what’s truly going on in the world around them, particularly when it comes to the workings of said world and the selective filtering of information about it. “Network” just might deservedly open a few eyes – and raise quite a few eyebrows at the same time.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 72), ('Comedy', 31), ('Documentary', 12), ('Romance', 11), ('Other', 69)]}]",100,Yes!

It's now common knowledge that Pirates Of The Caribbean is a film based upon a theme park ride of the same name, thoughg that ride is not actually a roller-coaster, it's fair to say that this film most assuredly is. A swashbuckling ripper of an adventure yarn cramming in every pirate film staple it can and pouring on layers of charm at every turn.

Dreams are windows to the imaginative capacity of the subconscious. Manipulating memories to fabricate worlds unbounded by the physical laws of reality. An endless wave of colours and possibilities, requiring no legitimacy for their existence. In psychology, dreams are a method for interrogating the mentality of its subject. Recurring nightmares could be a sign of stress-induced anxiety, fear or mental disorders. The late Satoshi Kon, in what was his last full feature, harnessed the concept of Tsutsui’s novel and challenged the limitations of Japanese animation once again. Paprika is the equivalent of a hallucinogenic warped mind-bending drug-induced fever dream that tests the attentive abilities of its audience. This is as “anime” as Kon’s work gets. Bashfully bonkers. Colourfully confusing. And plenty of Paprika. Whilst ‘Perfect Blue’ is his most accessible feature for adults, Paprika tends to engage itself with fans of the art form instead. That’s not a derogatory trait to have, as it allows Kon to exercise his visionary ingenuity one last time, but the narrative requires patience. A quaint approach that resembles the personality of doctor Chiba, the head scientist of a revolutionary new psychotherapy treatment creatively entitled “Dream Therapy”. But when a dream recording device is stolen, a plague of nonsensical dreams start to merge with the realms of reality. A parade of dancing frogs, strange dolls, wiggling electronic appliances, colossal Shinto gates and golden cat statues just to name a few composites of the ominous fever dream that plagues the minds of unsuspecting dreamers. Infiltrating such a cluster bomb of visual splendour would be no simple task for Chiba’s dream alter-ego Paprika, when at one point she is groped by a colleague who physically splits her fleshed shell in half (not nearly as traumatic as it sounds though...). Yet beneath the mesmerising dream-bending extravaganza is a narrative centralising on the sophisticated theme of control. Taking one’s life back. Detective Konakawa represents this exquisitely when trialling out the “DC Mini” device to treat his anxiety. The recurring nightmarish dream regarding his homicide case prevents him from being in control of his life, unable to watch films at the cinema due to past trauma in his childhood. The amalgamation of present and past within his dream perfectly illustrates the haunting abilities that our subconscious infects our mind with. From a non-scientific perspective, it’s a large reasoning for the development of mental disorders. Of course, the underdeveloped affection Chiba has for her obese child-at-heart genius colleague Tokita somewhat negates the central narrative on psychotherapy, but still focuses on the action of taking control. She finally manages her emotions during a time of distress, and that’s exactly what Paprika revolves around. The whole dream within a dream concept, which apparently was inspiration for Nolan’s epic ‘Inception’, is just a science-fiction shell that enabled Kon to express his creativity without diminishing the novel’s sense of originality. Not to mention Hirasawa’s euphoric score which inventively utilised a vocaloid name “Lola”. Will you fully understand the story on your first watch? Unlikely. Even with the occasionally clunky dialogue that explains the psychotherapy concept. This was the first anime feature film I ever watched (excluding the likes of Pokémon...), and now four watches later I finally understand every single detail of Kon’s cinematic piece of expressionistic art. It’s science-fiction at its most gentle. It’s psychology at its most cerebral. And it’s anime at its most “anime”.

That is the last place he wanted to be where he meets a mean boy and soon becomes his close friend. Being young kids, they tend to play some pranks with officials, visitors and themselves. That's one of the ways to cope with for where they have ended. So the remaining is to tell us would they get a second chance in their lives. ❝I don't know why I'm crying. Sometimes people cry because they're happy.❞ When some take up a project like this, they are not offered to make mistakes in choosing a weak screenplay. Because there are thousands of films in production around the world and in those, a handful of animated films, but probably he's only one up for a Stop-motion animated feature. Which means everyone with the knowledge of his commitment will be looking forward to it. So the filmmakers have opted to adapt a novel, which is always a best option in filmmaking. The next is the characters. Making them come alive, particularly initial stage, the creation of models. Yep, they have done that job as well so well. Gooding looking ones, especially among the kids for having similarity with their vision. The frame rate was good. Very smoother for viewing. So technically it was a flawless for the normal watch. An impressive storyline, which might serve as a tearjerker for a few. There's a little romance, but from the children's perspective of having a crush. Since the girl character was introduced, the narration takes a fresh look. The following event becomes even more adventurous and fun filled till the end. The voice-over was excellent. From the dialogues to the film scenes very impressive. It marks the directional debut for a short filmmaker. An appreciable work and I hope he makes more like them with new technics than migrating to computer animations. One of the advantages is it is a short and sweet film, but those who love such films might feel it is too short. Most importantly, there're not clichés like what we've seen films that takes place in the orphanages. The opening was shocking. If it was a real life, the boy would have ended in a different place. Still the emotional parts were less explored, yet very convincing for not leaning too much on that facet. The film is one of the best in its kind, but I agree it's not a masterpiece. Not if you have seen plenty of Stop-motion animations in your life. Yet it can't be neglected that easily and surely it is for everyone. I know there are folks who thinks this format of films are for little ones, but the truth is they are still in the pre 90s mindset. This is good, give it a try and you might love it. Anyway, for its rareness itself highly recommended, then you decided how do you liked it or not. 7/10"", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 58), ('Comedy', 42), ('Romance', 22), ('Family', 18), ('Other', 104)]}]",100,Yes!

I think what happened to me was exactly the same as what happened to most people: when I saw this movie for the first time, years ago, I didn't understand a thing. That went on for a long time: whenever I saw this film, I ended up not understanding it. That ended today, when I saw it with a friend of mine, who also likes cinema and who told me“you have to keep two things in mind: the first is the non-linear narrative, sometimes with very subtle changes; the second is that most of the film is not real life, it is a dream of the protagonist”. If there are films that are almost perfect, this one is close to it, although it is not easy to understand, and it is necessary to watch it five or six times to understand it well. I had already the experience that David Lynch's films are not easy... I had my first contact with the director a few years ago, withBlue Velvet, and I realized that he makes hermetic films, with implicit ideas and dreamlike suggestions, which often (almost always) escape our eyes. I like that: it's a challenging kind of cinema, which makes you think and moves you. It doesn't mean that I understand everything! And today, talking with my friend, I finally managed to understand this film better. Initially made in 1999 as a pilot episode for a TV series, it was made into a feature film after TV producers rejected the product. The very way Lynch took his failure and turned it into one of his biggest hits is remarkable, revealing his style and persistence. The film is really good, and I believe that, by commenting on what I learned today, I am already helping those who want to see it and understand it. If we pay attention, it indicates the moments when the main character falls asleep (right at the beginning) and wakes up again. And I think I can still say, without revealing too much, that the party at the film director's house, very close to the end, is the key scene to understand more than half of the plot, which basically focuses on a young woman, who goes to Los Angeles with the dream of becoming rich and famous and fails in that desire, combining this frustration with a huge love heartbreak, and the loss of her own moral values \u200b\u200band innocence. The cast is perfectly up to the challenges they're getting from the director, and it's amazing to see Naomi Watts here. This film truly symbolizes the start of her career, as she only did a few minor jobs, in Europe and the USA, until making this film. She is truly excellent, managing to capture all our sympathy and make us like her character. To a certain extent, I think the actress saw a lot of herself in the character she played: she also had a dream of succeeding in her career, and she also suffered to achieve it. Also, Laura Harring did very well and deserves praise for her work. Justin Theroux, who played director Adam Kesher, makes a welcome and solid contribution to the work of the actresses, even though this film is clearly dominated by them. Technically, this is a film class at all levels. In addition to the brilliant direction, Lynch bets a lot on cinematography. Here, it is worth seeing how he uses the locations he chooses, the cityscapes, and some techniques such as zoom, close-up or blur, to convey messages to the audience about the characters' state of mind. He also makes good use of color, vibrant and beautiful, with the colors red and blue having a particularly important meaning for understanding the film. The film has some intense nude and sex scenes, and a very slow pace that is intentional. The settings are also very important: sometimes, the arrangement of props and the way the actors relate to them helps us to understand what we see, but this is really subtle, and you have to be attentive. Finally, a very special word for the hypnotic and almost unforgettable soundtrack, signed by Angelo Badalamenti, which is worth listening to, from the main leitmotif to the songs, happy and carefree, in the style of the 50s."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '50%', 'review': 'A woman involved in a car accident emerges with amnesia and with the help of a would-be starlet they try to get to the bottom of who did what to whom and why.

If chosen, there\'s no turning back. As from this moment, The Triwizard Tournament has begun! Year four at Hogwarts for Harry Potter and his chums, and it\'s a time of change, chance and danger. The prestigious Triwizard Tournament is being hosted and the applecart is turned upside down when Harry, unqualified and underage, is selected by the Goblet of Fire to be one of Hogwarts\' competitors. If the thought of competing in such a dangerous tournament wasn\'t scary enough, Harry also has the worry of finding a date for the Yule Ball to contend with! The Prisoner of Azkaban set the marker for a darker, more grown up Potter picture, a high standard that Goblet of Fire, and new director Mike Newell, arguably had no hope of attaining. But it\'s not for lack of trying, and in fairness Newell and the team have managed well enough to blend the blackness that comes with the impending arrival of Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes), with the burgeoning ping of teenager hormones. There\'s an awful lot going on here. With the Triwizard Tournament comes two groups of exchange students to Hogwarts in the form of the glamorous girls of Beauxbatons Academy, and the hunky boys of Durmstrang Institute. The arrival of which sends Ron, Hermione and co into blushy flustered awakenings. The tournament itself (rightly) dominates much of the film, the lead up to it and the three challenges that the competitors have to face, with Harry\'s dragon face off a bona fide excellent piece of film. Then on to the fall out of the tournament where it gets real dark and the film and series lurch on to another level and set up the next installment a treat. As is customary for a Potter film, there\'s also a number of new characters and replaced characters in the mix, while major story developments flit in and out of the narrative to the point you really have to pay attention completely. Of the new arrivals it\'s Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson terrific) who is most telling and enjoyable, but tabloid scribe Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson) is something the film could have survived without. Yes it\'s a nice pop at the gutter press, but watching it now, would the time spent wasted on Skeeter not have been better served on the sadly under filmed Quidditch World Cup? Especially considering the build up to it is magnificent. Or at the very least some more Malfoy Senior, Sirius or Snape! But the disappointment felt there is offset some by the wonderful Yule Ball, where Newell is in his element gleefully dangling his charges through the joys and sorrows of awkward awakenings. It\'s a series highlight that\'s not to be missed. A film of variable pace due to the makers trying to juggle so much, it\'s ultimately something of an up and down viewing experience. That said, Newell is able to dazzle the pre-teens with his set pieces, because the kiddies sure as hell will not understand the angst and hormonal issues present, while the rest plays out on adult terms. So something for everyone, then. It may not be successful as a whole, and newcomers dipping in for the first time get no guidance at all, but it\'s still a ripper of a ride for those who are into the films having not read the books.

His acting is refined and mature and he does an excellent job portraying his emotions with not only his line delivery but his facial expressions and body language. He really broke through here and it was a joy to see. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were great, but they had a slight decrease in screentime and really were sidelined during this film. The introduction of Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory brings an interesting dynamic to the story, as Harry Potter has somewhat of an older brother figure to contend with. The relationship and chemistry between the two builds and brings some emotionally heavy scenes throughout. There is constant action in this film; from the opening scenes of the Quidditch World Cup to the multiple rounds of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, there is always something happening, and it helps create a very steady pace throughout. Not only is there action, but there is also fantastic character development. All of our characters really start to come into their own through the struggles they all face throughout the film. Harry is the best he's ever been, and the new faces are great on screen. Alastor Moody is mysterious and quirky and is a great mentor to Harry. But the greatest thing about this film is the sinster introduction of Lord Voldemort. His presence was lurking in the background of the entire series, but here he is reborn in a horrifying way.

And this latest offering in this genre does just that in telling the story of two Senegalese teens as they make the perilous attempt to find their way to a new life in Italy. Writer-director Matteo Garrone tells the harrowing tale of cousins Seydou (Seydou Sarr) and Moussa (Moustapha Fall) as they wrestle with the challenges of the environment, unrepentant scammers, forced detention and torture by authorities and criminals, and the harsh conditions of crossing the Mediterranean. However, while the film features fine performances, cinematography and location settings, it all seems a little too familiar, a tale with a hole-filled plot and a series of cliffhangers that seem to have all-too-convenient solutions to them. It’s also overlong, filled with a variety of sequences that could have been easily pared back without losing anything meaningful. Nevertheless, these shortcomings are countered, to a certain extent, by an intriguing mystical and surreal subtext, which is actually the picture’s strongest (though most woefully underdeveloped) aspect. In light of the foregoing, then, I must admit that I’m somewhat mystified how this release managed to secure so many accolades, including Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for best international film, especially given how many other better offerings were available. “Io Capitano” is one of those movies that makes a good instructional picture for those who’d like to know more about the plight of this new wave of immigrants, but its hype seems a bit inflated in the face of previous releases on this subject and other foreign language offerings more deserving of the praise.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 72), ('Comedy', 31), ('Documentary', 12), ('Romance', 11), ('Other', 69)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'At times this is a really quite harrowing film to watch as we follow two cousins ""Seydou"" (Seydou Sarr) and ""Moussa"" (Moustapha Fall) on one hell of a journey.

A Danish war-drama that was inspired by the historical account, but all the characters were fictional. Remember this title for another six month, because I am confident this film will make a journey to the west coast of the USA to compete at the 89th Academy Awards in the coming February. I have seen many foreign films, but I\'m not this much positive for any others. If this film fails to make, then that would be a great disappointment despite having no idea of what are the other four films. So this is just for now, my stance may change later. Anyway, the film was heartbreakingly amazing. The WWII stories I had seen those told from the perspectives of the Australian, Japanese, Korean, Russian to African and European to the American western sea, Hawaii. And this is a Danish story, sets in just after the end of the war where prisoners of the war were used to clean up the mess. In the opening the teen German POWs were trained to defuse the land mine explosives and then later the unit was handed over to the Danish sergeant Carl Rasmussen where they are all going to work in one of the west coast landmines that was used to defend the Scandinavia by the Nazi. That is the story told how it all ends in the remaining parts. This was like another \'Kajaki\', but not actually a war film. Using of the prisoners as the labourers is a violation, according to the Geneva rule. That\'s the point of the film, focused to reveal the inhume act. But it was not anything like \'The Railway Man\' \'Unbroken\' or the \'The Bridge on the River Kwai\'. Watching a film about the brave soldiers inspires us and bring patriotism, but in this those teen kid screaming whenever something goes wrong really brings heartache. So not everybody feels comfortable with it, especially the family audience. But there were lots of edgy moments and you would never know what events follows. ""If they are old enough to go to war, they are old enough to clean up."" It was shot is the real location, and I think that part contributed to depicting the actual atmosphere where most of the POWs lost their arms and legs and some exploded into many pieces in the air. It was a simple narration, but the visuals talked itself more than anything else. All the actors were outstanding, especially those 4-5 German teens and of course the Danish sergeant Carl. I think the Carl\'s influence had more impact, after seeing the opening scene where he went outrage and beat up those German soldiers returning home. There are a couple of small twists, but there are some scenes which are not easy to get over. Even though we know those were just fake, but that does not work once you totally into the story deeply. This is a different kind of emotional film, something you rarely experience. The director who is also the writer must be appreciated for handling it perfectly. Especially keeping the screenplay uncomplicated and between the two nations, where in the real event involves the British officials. I have never seen his other films, but this one will define him forth and the people are going to recognise him. So I hope he\'ll keep up doing such level films in the future. I have never seen such film, I mean seen some where the kids were tortured, but this was very unique and totally a different perspective for that takes place in the backdrop of the WWII. Especially the Germans perspective is the very rare kind. So I\'m kind of thinking if Germany picks \'Look Who\'s Back\' for the Oscars, the contest between these two would bring two different moods. At this point I don\'t remember any Danish film I have seen so far in my life other than this one which I feel is the best Danish film ever. I mean, come on, who would do such film where your own nation, if not the whole nation, the one who represent was shown in the negative shade over the Nazi Germans.

The film tells the story of German POWs who were ordered to clear landmines in Denmark after the war. These are not your stereotypically evil Nazi officers, but pubescent foot soldiers — if they seem like scared little children, it’s because they pretty much are. The locals, military and civilian alike, treat the Germans like a bunch of red-headed stepsons — completely disposable, forced to \'practice\' with real, active mines, and sent to a beach under whose sands there are 45,000 buried explosive devices. ""Assuming you deactivate six mines an hour and don\'t blow yourselves to bits, you\'ll be home in three months,"" tells them Sergeant Rasmussen (Roland Møller), whom we first meet when he’s bashing a surrendering German soldier’s skull in for carrying a Danish flag in his hand. Under Sandet’s premise explores an overlooked aspect of World War II, but the film\'s power lies not in what it reveals, but in what it doesn\'t. At a certain point, one of the boys is unlucky enough to find a mine right on top of another mine; the poor wretch doesn’t live long enough to realize this fact, but his ignorance of the situation does not in the least lessen its impact. Similarly, writer/director Martin Zandvliet has crafted a figuratively equally explosive palimpsest. Depending on how steeped the viewer is in the historical context, the Danes\' attitude is petty at best and hypocritical at worst. In addition to irony so subtle it’s almost subliminal, Under Sandet is a rather literal illustration of Hitchcock’s notions on suspense. This suspense remains effective even if we can predict some of the characters’ fates (for instances, one would have to be exceedingly naïve to see a pair of brothers — and twins, no less — in a story like this and expect them both to survive).', 'most_watched_genres': []}]",100,Yes!

In this one New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) flies to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his wife & kids. When McClane visits Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at her company’s Christmas party a group of radical criminals take control of the skyscraper. Alan Rickman plays the nefarious mastermind of the operation while Reginald VelJohnson plays a cop on the ground that befriends McClane via walkie talkie. Meanwhile Paul Gleason is on hand as an exasperating police chief. This franchise fills the bill if you\'re in the mood for big, dumb, fun action thrills. Don\'t get me wrong because a lot of work goes into making these kinds of films and it takes talent & genius to pull them off. I mean ""dumb"" in the sense that the focus is on unbelievable action rather than deeper themes beyond ""genuinely good people may be flawed, cocky and somewhat profane, but they\'re courageous and never give up in the face of evil."" The Die Hard flicks are the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977\'s ""The Gauntlet"" where the action scenes are so overdone they\'re cartoony, but entertaining. There\'s a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001\'s ""The Mummy Returns."" Thankfully, ""Die Hard"" evades that ditch because it’s not too over-the-top and it offers entertaining protagonists & antagonists, amusing one-liners, worthy bits of character development and a compelling comic booky story. While all five Die Hard movies are of the same action expertise, I prefer the sequels because this one takes place almost entirely in and around a skyscraper. I favor the wider location scope of the others. THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot entirely in Los Angeles.

Based on ex cop Roderick Thorpe\'s 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever, Die Hard, directed by John McTiernan, changed the face of the action movie. Starring Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, Alexander Godunov, William Atherton & Paul Gleason, McTiernan\'s movie went on to make over $100 million in profit at the box office alone. Spawning three equally successful sequels (at the time of writing), it began a franchise that showed that if done well, the action movie could be a dominant force in the world of cinema. The set up is relatively simple, Willis plays New York cop John McLane who during the Christmas holidays is in L.A. to visit his estranged wife Holly (Bedelia). She works for the Japanese Corporation of Nakatomi, and currently she\'s attending the company Christmas party up on the 30th floor of the humongous Nakatomi Plaza tower block. Bad day at the office because a group of apparent German terrorists, led by the charismatic Hans Gruber (Rickman), take the whole building hostage: with one exception; McLane, who evades capture and launches a one man war against the terrorists. What follows is just over two hours of high octane action, smart dialogue and technical smarts. McTiernan had already endeared himself to the action movie fan with the ball busting beef stew that was Predator in 87, a fact not lost on Die Hard\'s co producer Joel Silver, who clearly knew that McTiernan could smoothly shift the action from the Val Verde jungle to the urban jungle of L.A. And he did. Next was to get the right man for McLane. Richard Gere was first choice but passed, so the makers took a gamble on Willis, whose career was at a standstill after his leap from TV show Moonlighting on to the big screen with the likes of Blind Date & Sunset barely making a ripple in Hollywood. The rest for Willis, as they say, is history. McLane is an everyman hero, streetwise, even slobbish, but identifiable to many with his work ethics, desperate heroics and emotional vulnerability. Willis attacks the role with a hunger rarely seen from the big male earners in filmdom. During the two hours and ten minute running time of Die Hard, Willis as McLane changed the face of the action hero for ever; even making a dirty white vest iconic in the process; the latter of which couples nicely with the hero being bare footed throughout for a nifty bit of writing. Across the board the casting is flawless, Bedelia is spunky and driven, a woman worth fighting for. Veljohnson as beat copper Al Powell-McLane\'s walkie-talkie buddy and only link to the outside world-is memorable because it feels real, he has his own issue gnawing away at him, but his exchanges with Willis keeps the humanity grounded as the carnage unfolds. Gleason & Atherton are wonderfully anal as Deputy Police Chief and TV Reporter respectively, while Hart Bochner as Ellis dishes out one of the best weasel turns to have ever graced a movie featuring corporate suit types. But as Die Hard resembles the great Westerns of yesteryear, much like the great Oaters, Die Hard could only be as good as its chief villain. As Willis\' McLane ushered in a new action hero to copy, Rickman\'s uber intelligent villain set a new benchmark. Snappily dressed, well versed and as charming as they come, Gruber in Rickman\'s hands is a villain you could quite easily root for! That\'s further testament to Willis\' turn that Rickman doesn\'t walk away with the movie, both men are from different sides of the fence, good and evil, yet both are characters you can hang your hat on. Quite a trick from McTiernan that. Rickman is ably supported by the scary Godunov as right hand man Karl and Clarence Gilyard Jr. as the cold hearted Theo. Elsewhere the impact of Robert Davi & Grand L. Bush as the two cocksure FBI agents Johnson & Johnson (no relation) should not be underestimated. All the actors, of course, are indebted to the sizzling script by Steven E. de Souza & Jeb Stuart. So to is praise due to photographer Jan de Bont, who in collaboration with McTiernan, produces a camera work lesson for action movies, as the camera swoops in and around the tower, down elevator shafts and up tilt to roofs; with the fight scenes afforded a spatial sheen not expected in the confines of a tower block setting (the film was actually shot at 20th Century Fox\'s own 2121 Fox Plaza). Even the scoring from Michael Kamen and the sound tracking are of a high standard; check out the various ""mood"" uses of Beethoven\'s Ode to Joy from Symphony No.9 and Bach\'s Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 In G Major: Brilliant. The 80s was well served by action movies with the likes of Lethal Weapon and Beverly Hills Cop proving massively popular. But just as Raiders Of The Lost Ark changed the game for action/adventure, so too did Die Hard. It\'s now the benchmark movie for action, a film that unlike Hills Cop & Lethal Weapon remarkably shows no signs of ageing either. It\'s no monkey in the wrench or a fly in the ointment, it\'s the daddy, and the one that all other action movies have to answer to. 10/10', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 43), ('Thriller', 42), ('Crime', 34), ('Action', 29), ('Other', 111)]}, {'writer': 'The Movie Mob', 'score': '100%', 'review': ""Die Hard's fresh take on action heroes, excellent directing and pacing, and explosive effects make it a near-perfect action film and one of the finest of the genre.

Yet it still remains a unique and nightmarish piece of film making, the sort of picture that if someone like David Lynch had made it in the modern era it would be heralded as a masterpiece of daring and genius like artistry.

On the one hand, I can't say that I didn't enjoy 'Freaks', mainly because of its nice display of bizarre cast members. On the other hand, I can't help feeling slightly at fault, considering that these were real people who probably suffered a lot in their lives because of their malformations, something they obviously couldn't help. Here's a movie that basically became popular precisely because it's about real life 'freaks' (?) and here's the audience that somehow takes pleasure from a film that consciously makes profit out of unfortunate human beings. Being aware of this, I can't lie and say that I didn't enjoy this movie, because… I honestly did!. I'm not going to say that 'Freaks' fascinated me because of the plot, or the locations or the unspoken moral, because even though all those things were fine too, I mostly wanted to see the film because of its characters, that's the reality. However, I suppose it is not so bad to enjoy this movie because of this reason, considering that these people actually agreed to appear in the movie and the fact that they appeared here, didn't make their lives any better or worse, so in the end… it's not really a crime, but I can't help having vague ideas about it. As the movie begins, we see a scrolling prologue, which pretty much encourages the audience to root for the side-show performers and incite us to feel terrible for them, since people with deformities has been always predestined to the most awful chastisements and degradations… which worked for me!. I felt really bad at first, but in the end, it was comprehensible that this film clearly tries to give a message in a far-reaching and yet hideously pleasurable approach. Therefore, my personal opinion, is that the title 'Freaks', doesn't necessarily have to be a reference to the side-show performers with malformations and perhaps, it may be an allusion to the fully grown characters who were the real freaks because of their wicked hearts. In 'Freaks' the story revolves around a circus that offers all kinds of shows, including the exhibition of people with malformations as if they were exotic animals. Cleopatra, a beautiful and promiscuous trapeze artist from the circus, maliciously deceives an innocent midget named Hans and makes him believe that she is in love with him. On the other hand, Frieda, Hans' former fiancée, hopelessly tries to warn his beloved one and make him realize that Cleopatra is just making fun of him deliberately and that she's only with him because of his money. Ignoring Frieda's friendly warning, Hans eventually marries the trapeze artist, only to realize that she was indeed poking fun at him from the very beginning and that her only business with him is to poison him to inherit his wealth later. However, the rest of the side-show performers become aware of this and decide to rise up against the vicious Cleopatra and her lover Hercules. Like I said, the film is remarkably engaging and regardless of the unassuming plot and the short duration, it still doesn't leave the audience with a feeling of disappointment. For the contrary, during that short hour and four minutes, the movie pretty much develops all the necessary conflicts, situations, beautiful music, nice scenarios and perfect interaction between the characters.

Thankfully, his efforts didn’t go unnoticed, at last receiving the recognition for what he did, earning him the gratitude of the survivors and the honors of a grateful nation, in essence becoming the UK’s counterpart to Oskar Schindler. Director James Hawes tells a compelling story in his debut feature film, though the execution, regrettably, could use some shoring up, especially in the film’s sluggishly paced, overly talky and occasionally meandering opening half. The picture’s back end, however, considerably makes up for these deficiencies, evoking genuine, well-earned, heartfelt emotions, qualities that could have made for a better release overall if they had been employed more fully earlier on. This is largely made possible by the powerful performances of Hopkins, Flynn, Bonham Carter and a host of supporting players, along with fine period piece production values. “One Life” ultimately delivers a message that we could all stand to hear more often, not only in supporting monumental undertakings like those depicted here, but also in being giving of ourselves in general, no matter how great or small the efforts or ventures might be. The world would certainly be a better place for doing so – and for the work of the Nicholas Wintons that reside within all of us.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 72), ('Comedy', 31), ('Documentary', 12), ('Romance', 11), ('Other', 69)]}, {'writer': 'tmdb51616167', 'score': '90%', 'review': 'Deciding to watch ""One Life"" with a group of young boys turned out to be a challenge, as they were not keen on sitting through a historical film. Despite the initial hesitation, the movie proved to be a captivating true story that left a lasting impact. The film follows the remarkable journey of a man from England who lived to the age of 106 and dedicated his life to a refugee rescue mission, saving nearly 700 children. The emotional core of the story comes to life when these children, now adults, reunite with the man who changed their lives on a television show, expressing their heartfelt gratitude. Set against the backdrop of World War II and the atrocities of Hitler, ""One Life"" offers a poignant and powerful narrative that showcases the resilience and compassion of the human spirit. While it may not be a blockbuster film that demands a trip to the theaters, it is a movie worth watching for its historical significance and moving storytelling. Led by the talented Anthony Hopkins, the cast delivers compelling performances that elevate the film\'s impact.

It stars Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito and David Strathairn. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Dante Spinotti. It\'s 1950s Los Angeles and three cops of very different morals and stature are about to be entwined in crime and corruption... I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjunct to the job. Tremendous film making. Hanson takes Ellroy\'s labyrinthine story and pumps it with period authenticity and seamless direction, the latter of which sees him garner superlative performances from the cast. This is the side of Los Angeles nobody wants to talk about, it\'s awash with corpses, hookers, seedy set-ups, violence, drugs, racism and corruption a go-go. And that\'s just involving the politicians, the press and the coppers! Rollo Tomasi. The absence of genuine heroes on show still further keeps ""The City of Angels"" covered in dark clouds, where even as the plot twists and turns, as the mysteries unravel and brutality unfurls, the final destination of the principal characters is never clear, thus there\'s a continuing edge of seat pulse beat within the pic. It\'s also sexy and dangerous, the dialogue sharper than a serpent\'s tooth, and while the ending is a little too cosy as opposed to original noir wave conventions, this is pure noir in all but black and white photography. It won only two Academy Awards, Basinger for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and for Hanson and Hegeland for Best Writing - Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published.

My favorite scene is when he lays in bed next to Adrian with the sudden realization that he cannot win this fight. It was an incredibly vulnerable moment for him and worked really well. As I said before, the dialogue is very inconsistent, especially in the scene at Rocky's house with Adrian. It was very unsettling to watch because she is written as if she does not want to be there, but then the next second she is in love with him. It was very weird and creepy. On the other hand, in some scenes, the dialogue is written very well, which lends itself to boosting the actors' performances. But when it is off, the acting on display is negatively affected. Despite that, this movie gets a lot more right than it does wrong in the script department. Technically, this film excels. The score is fantastic, with one of the most iconic songs in cinematic history.

On one level this film is about cruelty. Not a deliberate, malevolent style of cruelty - but one of indifference, of ignorance - a bully\'s sort of cruelty. On another it is a story of love, loyalty - betrayal even. It is an highly emotional film with two excellent performances from the young boys conveying their respective responses to a bewildering array of suspicion and judgements being thrust their way by those who knew no better - but should have. It\'s about parenting, about openness and about how people deal with tragedy in their own, personal way - and it is very effective. It really does leave a lump in your throat afterwards.

I think that's very much most people's experience of film, you either love it or you don't. With Close, there's everything to love and it is an exercise in pure love, not just in its storyline but also the art of film, acting and storytelling. Importantly. It is akin to a dissection, an expert analysis of youth told through the eyes of two boys in tremendous pain. It is nuanced and a near savant, perceptive commentary on the predjudices cultivated within the human predicament from the very outset. It captures perfectly how instilled bigotry dessicates pure innocence from the moment a child sets foot into wider society via the educational system and it is a damning indictment of what we've become or failed to become, more accurately. The storyline shows how deep rooted prejudice can destroy a pure and innocent love between two boys, and it perfectly contrasts how the insipid and evil innuendo from female quarters feeds into to the outright violent machismo in male quarters, together combining to destroy the boys' idea of what their friendship was, to sully it unjustly and to make them feel that what was wonderful is wrong, to make them paranoid and defensive. It is a tale as old as time, the despicable and mean way jealous observers seek to destroy what they can't have, because they don't have that capacity. And it is infuriating as a viewer to see homophobia cast onto an innocent friendship at a tender age because it is precursive homophobia targeted at closeness, at innocent brotherly love. It is infuriating because it shows how deep rooted homophobia is in both girls' and boys' upbringing - bigotry that is used to target close friendship and innocence as a near precautionary measure, vaccinating the world at large against any male affection just in case it might turn into something more. There is much praise for this film and the writer/director Lukas Dhont is talented beyond what many critics seem to be able to bring themselves to admit, for he has, at a rather youthful age, created a work which leaves many in the industry probably wondering how he does it and where they went wrong. If Hollywood is the centre of the movie business, it is only due to money, and Lukas Dhont has, in this Belgian film, and as much French cinema has done before, shone a light on what cinema can and should be, and by comparison, he puts the typical offerings of Hollywood to shame. It is truly a comparison of fast food to haute cuisine. By way of another comparison and a similar study of loss, there was much praise for Aftersun and I gave it a great review. Having now seen Close, I think Aftersun is rudimentary in comparison and I wonder if the fact that Close is in French/Flemish is sufficient enough a reason for it to languish behind in terms of accolades and praise when compared to Aftersun, which, while deserving of much praise, is nothing of equal merit whatsoever - not even Close. For anyone wanting to learn about cinema and storytelling on screen, about acting and direction, Close is the objective to aim for, a masterclass in perfection.

The end of a trilogy, the end of an era of the universe of Batman through the eyes of Christopher Nolan. And baby, it goes out with a bang... Going into the theatre tonight I actually wasn't sure what I was up for. I loved Batman Begins, but I didn't actually care that much for The Dark Knight. So the big question was, will TDKR actually be more like the first or the second film? The answer is: neither. This third instalment of the Nolan-franchise carries its weight all on its own merits. Despite the lack of any kind of intro or opening credits, there actually is plenty of build-up (partly thanks to the insane opening scene). The foundation for a proper, action-packed story is laid down perfectly, explaining things just enough whilst keeping the viewer intrigued to find out more. But if you thought that Nolan couldn't surpass his previous work, you will be pleasantly deceived. Christian Bale as Batman is terrific. Never before was a superhero so human, so vulnerable. As his mask of intangibility and anonymity slowly starts to crumble, this is a man who questions his reasons to keep being who he is, and he must figure it out before it is too late. Because somebody’s preparing to take him and Gotham down, and he might just be too strong for the Batman... This somebody is a character called Bane. As a character, an actor and a performance it must be incredibly hard to follow Heath Ledger's The Joker, which was easily one of the greatest villains to ever appear on the silver screen. But tonight, Tom Hardy took a swing for the fence... and made it. His performance is thrilling and actually frightening, in the sense that you don't justknowyou're supposed to be afraid of this character, you actually FEEL it. He instils a feeling of horror and discomfort that is not rivalled by many other film villains. What I actually liked about his character the most is the fact that unlike Scarecrow, who grew into being a villain, and the Joker, who was just a raving maniac, Bane was actually (literally) born from evil. Born in hell, as it is said in the film. This is not a man, this is a creature. A living, breathing manifestation of evil that cannot be reasoned or negotiated with. Hardy's performance is masterful. Since his creepy mask is never removed, he, like only a few actors before him, must act without the use of any facial expressions, making his voice is main tool. His manner of speech (and the sound of it through his mask) is enough to send chills down your spine. This is more than just a another villain from a superhero flick, this is a character that just got torpedoed into the top 10 of the greatest antagonists in the history of film. Now I realise that's a bold statement to make, but you just go and watch TDKR and prove me wrong. I would say a slight downside to this film is the overflow of characters, both new and old. Aside from the already familiar characters, three new major ones are introduced. And there are also many characters running along in the margin which may seem not important enough to pay attention to, but actually they are so you need to stay focused. I understand the character of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Blake, was written in specifically for him because Nolan wanted him in it. And although as a character he works just fine, it does feel like it was at the expense of Gary Oldman. As a cop, Levitt does everything that Oldman's character could've done, but he spends most of his screen time in the hospital, almost like they wanted to get him out of the way, and that's really too bad. Now, I was extremely excited to see what Nolan had done with Catwoman, because she is one of my favourite film characters. When I heard that she would be played by Anne Hathaway, I had my doubts. I thought she was just way too sweet to pull this off. But I must say, Ms Hathaway did a pretty good job. She is actually much more sly and devious than I thought she could be. The Nolan brothers, on the other hand, disappointed me here. Catwoman isn't really Catwoman, she's just a sexy girl in a spandex suit who can kick your ass. Her movements aren't even typically cat-like... So that was a bit of a letdown. I would also like to make a note on Michael Caine. I think his performance here was so much deeper and more character-driven than the other two films. In fact, there is one scene in particular, where he confesses something to Bruce, that almost moved me to tears. And this is actually TDKR’s greatest strength; unlike the other two films, this one deals much more with actual human emotions, it gives us an insight into what actually drives these characters, both heroes and villains alike. As much as I would love to, the word-limit restricts me from elaborating more on the characters, so I'll just move on to the technical stuff. And in that department, actually pretty much everything was perfect. The pacing was very well balanced, and during those 2 ½ hours I didn't get bored once. Great action scenes alternate with more quiet moments, and the special effects are absolutely awesome. Hans Zimmer once again delivered a terrific score and there was some high quality dialogue. Also in store: a couple of great plot twists and two very cool cameos... There are a few plot holes, but everything else easily makes up for it. I highly recommend The Dark Knight Rises.

Thus, when Christopher Nolan brought us Batman Begins and steered away from the ridiculous comic shows that the previous batman movies (except the first one) had turned into I was thrilled. Unfortunately I was equally disappointed with this one. I think the title of the movie is quite misleading since Batman isn’t exactly rising at all but rather sinking. If this would have been a movie about some other “guy” it would probably have been excellent but it isn’t. It’s about Batman and as such I had expected him to be the hero going around beating up the bad guys. Instead the movie starts downright boring with Batman having dug himself down into a swamp of melancholy and closed himself off from the world. When he finally starts to appear again he gets pretty much beaten at every turn not to mention conned out of the Wayne fortune. What the f… is that? It isn’t until the end that he starts to be the real Batman and even then it’s not very exciting. Actually Batman, as in Batman and not Wayne, is not really in the movie for a good chunk of the time and the real hero in this movie is really the young cop and he sure isn’t a particularly good substitute for the superhero Batman that I was expecting to watch.

In fact, I think he's a hack whose only genuine talent is making stupid people falsely think they are actually quite smart. I am also a HUGE Dune fan. They have been my favourite series of books since I first discovered them as a teenager. So although I hoped for the best with this, I was expecting the worst. What I got was somewhere in the middle. It's an OK movie, not great, thankfully not terrible, but OK It got some things right the 1984 Lynch version got wrong, but still somehow managed to get other stuff wrong (including stuff Lynch got right). It was also a surprise how much Villeneuve just lifted directly from the Lynch film, both visually and auditorily. The wardrobe choices were a huge disappointment. If you didn't know the time setting, going just on the clothes in the new Dune you'd be forgiven for thinking it was set a mere forty or fifty years (if that) in the future rather than the twenty thousand years in the future when it's really set. The Lynch stillsuits look futuristic, unworldly, and something that really would keep you alive in the deep desert. The new desert wear looks like they are just going to go dirt biking for an hour or two in our present-day world. The casting (completely ignoring the pointless gender swap) was good, However, with the exception of Paul, Chani, and Rabban the original casting was all better. But the original (apart from the odd decision to use the totally unsuited Kyle MacLachlan) was a masterclass in how to cast the perfect people for the role. Anyway, enough of the comparisons, This film is about the first two-thirds of the first novel. I always thought the story would be better told via a big-budget TV series (or even mini-series) rather than a standalone movie. I still think what they tried to cover here was too much for a single movie, but it was a step in the right direction. The film mainly sticks to the book story but does make some needless changes, the most obvious of which being the changes made to both the gender and story of Liet Kynes, which in turn impacts the story of Chani. Most other changes are small and mainly insignificant though. The film being filmed in Norway, Jordan, and Abu Dhabi looks fantastic and very well suited to the large screen. And it's clear a great deal of time, effort, and money was put into the sets that looked equally good as the places they were meant to be. The acting was of a suitably high standard, but unfortunately, many of the Dune names and terms were horribly mispronounced. That and the Hans Zimmer fart that is played constantly throughout the soundtrack is likely to pull people out of their emersion in the movie. I was also somewhat surprised by what was left out, OK the source material is VERY dense and obviously some needed to be cut, but I don't really think it's made clear just how crucial melange is to the functioning of the empire and society as a whole. Also what (and why) mentats are is largely ignored, you may think that isn't overly important, but it is at the core of how many things are done in the Dune universe. Over all, it's not a bad movie. Despite its flaws, I still think the 1984 Lynch version is better though."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 33), ('Comedy', 19), ('Science Fiction', 18), ('Horror', 15), ('Other', 97)]}, {'writer': 'Peter McGinn', 'score': '60%', 'review': 'I enjoyed parts of this movie.

I was too young to really understand the plot at the time, but I didn’t care, all I knew was that the worms were awesome. When I got a little older, I read the book for my first time. It was the first “adult” book I read on my own, and I was in love with it ever since. I read it many more times growing up, and when the miniseries came out, I watched and recorded it every night, then re-watched it time and time again. When “Children of Dune” aired, I again devoured it happily. In the case of the Lynch film, as I grew, I of course began to see more and more of the flaws, though I personally hold the “Spicediver Edit” in quite high esteem. That particular cut of the film manages to make the Lynch version into what is a genuinely good film, but still imperfect. The miniseries has, up until now, remained my preferred adaptation. Now we have a new adaptation: Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune”, and it certainly is quite different from the previous two versions in many ways, but is it good? Well, at least from my perspective, that answer is complicated. The short version is yes, it is a good film, but it’s not a great one.\n\nThe gist of the story is straightforward. Many, many millennia in the future, Paul, the son of the Duke Leto Atreides, finds himself and his family caught in plots of intrigue, and betrayal, after taking custody of a new and valuable planet. In order to survive, he finds that he will have to depend on the training of his mother, the Lady Jessica, the help of the planets local population, the fremen, and his growing awareness of a great, yet possibly terrible destiny that waits for him. \n\nIn reality though, the story is anything but. The novel is infamous for being “unadaptable” with its complex “plots within plots” storyline, along with its sheer size. There is simply too much going on in the story to make it easy to turn into a film, or even a series. The previous efforts have all brought different aspects of the novel to the forefront, and this new version is no different. In broad strokes, it is perhaps the most faithful to the novel in terms of themes, and it certainly emphasizes some aspects of the political commentary behind the novel, such as the missionaria protectiva, which was nowhere to be found in the Lynch film, and only really hinted at in the miniseries. They also spend a little more time focusing on the fremen and their sentiments toward off-worlders after living under the Harkonnen regime, but unfortunately, while it is nice to see these themes in the film, they are undercut by little development. In fact, the entire film suffers on that front. So much of the political context and scheming has been left out that the film as presented feels somehow empty. \n\nEarly in the film, it is established that the emperor considers the Duke Leto a threat due to his popularity, but never really explores too much beyond it. Even more strangely, the film establishes this, but then later makes it seem like they were never really certain about the fact that the emperor was involved in a key scene, unlike the book, where the Duke was fully aware that they were heading into a trap, and was attempting to outmaneuver his political opponents. The Baron Harkonnen is limited to a few admittedly atmospheric scenes where he more or less confirms the emperor is aiding him in their goal to destroy the Atreides line, but it is reduced to a few scant lines, the bare minimum necessary to understand the plot. This, unfortunately results in very shallow characterization, and the same problem runs throughout the film. Gurney Halleck, Thufir Hawat, and Doctor Yueh are all present, but each of them is only given a small handful of scenes, in which they only speak a few lines each, before they are forgotten to focus on Paul, or beautiful scenic shots. They never feel like fully realized characters in the film, more as brief supporting roles, whom are only present in order to fulfill their roles in the larger storyline. Thufir Hawat receives perhaps the worst treatment in this regard. Even the primary cast are not given a lot of development. We are given enough to know who they are, and a little of their personality, but nothing more. It seems strange, that the longest adaptation of the first half of the novel ever made should have less detail and character than either previous version. It does however, and it certainly hurts the film as a result. Long, moody shots are great, but only when they exist in addition with actual depth. The plot of the film has been streamlined to the point that it feels watered-down, and genuinely wastes the talents of its cast all stuck in roles that have been similarly effected. \n\nThere are also a few key scenes that actively go against things covered in the book. One scene features the Lady Jessica speaking of secretive matters regarding the bene gesserit sisterhood while sitting in the cockpit of an ornithopter right behind Thufir Hawat, whom would be easily able to hear everything she had just said. Another moment, involves the Reverend Mother Mohiam referring to Jessica as Leto’s “wife”, even though she would know full well that they aren’t married. Yet another moment involves that Shadout Mapes pulling out a crysknife to offer it to Jessica while out in the open, and Jessica is in the presence of guards. The Shadout later sheathes the knife unblooded, and those who have read the book will know why that choice does not work for the film, especially in the context of fremen later being shown cutting themselves before sheathing their knives. Of course, in any adaptation there will be liberties taken, and there are indeed more, but these three moments in particular certainly seem to stand out the most in regards to actively going against aspects of the original novel, and in doing so, hurt this film as an adaptation.\n\nWith that said, there were things I liked as well. As I have stated a number of times, the film is gorgeous. There are a couple of scenes that certainly seemed to be more “style over substances”, such as a shot of ships rising from the ocean for… no apparent reason, but man do they look beautiful. There is also a very real sense of scale in the film that I can freely admit neither previous version ever accomplished. As a result, there are a few scenes that do far better match their description in the book, and are glorious to watch.\n\nI do really appreciate the way they portray the emperor, discussed, but never seen. A powerful force that can be felt looming in the background, his hand guiding everything happening. He is built up excellently, and I will be curious to see how well he is portrayed if we get a sequel. In the previous adaptations, he was prominently displayed and used to provide greater context for the politics of the story, but in the book, he is only ever seen in the end, and keeping book accurate in this case certainly works very well.\n\nThe film also features the most book accurate version of Paul’s growing prescience, hinting at possible outcomes rather than complete premonitions. The way it is executed is not necessarily without its flaws, or heavy-handedness in a couple of moments, but it works well. Similarly, we also get the story of the bull and Leto’s father for the first time, though the film attempts to make the bull symbolic in a manner I am not sure really works, or is earned.\u3000Also notable is the death of a significant character finally matching their death in the novel. \n\nI have also stated that the cast does a great job, and I stand by that. In the entire film, there is not a bad performance in the film. My only complaint would be with the portrayal of the Lady Jessica, who comes across as too emotional, presumably in an attempt to show her ability to shift from being upset to being entirely refined and composed in moments, but that is a matter of writing rather than performance. When it comes to the casting, I personally felt that many of the actors matched their roles well, in particular enjoying the casting of Duke Leto and the Baron. I did not however care much for the gender-swapping of Liet, which served no real purpose, especially when one considers how small the characters role was in this version of the film, though Sharon Duncan-Brewster did a good job with what she had. I also did not care for the casting of Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica. While she is a very good actress, she seemed to me a bit too “girl next door”, rather than the character from the novel that the Duke Leto notes “reintroduced regality into the Atreides line”. \n\nWhen it comes to the score, I will admit that I was not certain how I would feel in regards to Hans Zimmer’s work on the film. The samples I had heard up until this point had been interesting, but I was not sure how it would work in terms of the film itself. I can say that it works well, though there are moments when it feels almost as watered-down as the plot itself. It never really allowed me to feel excited at any point, but it did match the tone of the film very well, and I can easily see myself turning it on whenever I clean my house in order to set a “mood” (Ha! See what I did there?). \n\nIn conclusion, despite my criticisms, I did enjoy the film. I think it works well enough to be understood, though there may be some moments where the average viewer could find themselves feeling confused. It certainly is a visual spectacle, but one undercut by excessive trimming of detail and world-building. I hope it is successful enough to warrant a sequel in order to finish the story, but I also find that I will not be upset if it does not. As adaptations go, this is no “The Lord of the Rings”. In the end, I have to rate this version of “Dune” closer to the original Lynch film, and maintain the miniseries as my favorite adaptation of an amazing novel.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Action', 26), ('Drama', 24), ('Science Fiction', 22), ('Adventure', 21), ('Other', 74)]}, {'writer': 'Habenula', 'score': '10%', 'review': ""The worst movie I've ever seen.

At that age, I probably didn\'t get the subtext message. I never saw any movies of it so I decided to watch both the 1984 Dune by David Lynch and the 2021 Denis Villeneuve version sequentially. I\'m going to talk about both of them here. This may not be a popular opinion: Lynch\'s version isbrilliantand the Villeneuve Dune is absoluteshit. Here\'s why: First, is the Villeneuve Dune slick? Yes, absolutely. I should hope so considering it\'s nearly 40 years after Lynch did his, for crissake. Are the character\'s in David Lynch\'s version kitschy and over the top? Yes! That\'s one reason it\'s so much better! It\'s Sci Fi, duh! You watch Marvel movies and suspend disbelief for incredible, imaginary super powers? All of Lynch\'s characters are downright gritty and believable within this particular surreal fantasy. By the end of the Lynch Dune, I had sympathy for nearly every character in the film. Even the villains caught my emotions. Paul Atreides character development was realistic and attractive. Villeneuve\'s characters? I felt like my neighbor came over and asked, ""Hey, can you come to watch my kid\'s junior high school play?"" ""Sure, Denis, just let me fill my 1-liter flask with tequila first."" Villeneuve\'s characters were so damned flat and lifeless that they evoked NO emotional response whatsoever. Although I occasionally sit through a bad flick, I can\'t remember recently watching a movie as awful character-wise, as the 2021 Dune. If I were an actor on that set, I would be silently screaming. How does a director even do this? Oh, and where\'s the creativity? It\'s 46 years since George Lucas founded Industrial Light & Magic, and Denis can\'t create one single, new, goddamn space machine 46 years later? (One could argue the hummingbird copter is new, but it\'s not so creative when you realize that we didn\'t even know how hummingbird wings actually worked until this millennia.) But here\'s the real clincher: the screenplay. David Lynch gave us a complete story. Sadly, he didn\'t have the final cut and disowned his film when the critics panned it. Despite the fact that Lynch is a true artist and genius, the studio took 45 minutes out of the film. 45 minutes! Even ruined by the studio, even 40 years later, Lynch\'s film has a clear vision and carries the timeless message that Frank Herbert intended. I would LOVE to see the original cut! Villeneuve, on the other hand, stopped abruptly in the middle of the book. I now realize that Denis is not about the story. Denis is all about the franchise money, and that sucks. As a result of the bad screenplay, this 2021 version doesn\'t even carry the socio-political statement it was supposed to have. I want my 155 minutes back. I don\'t watch Part 2s, especially when it comes to void-of-creativity and void-of-character-development Hollywood movies. You can take your bad franchise and shove it up your sci fi black hole. Admittedly, I loved Blade Runner 2049, but this is so disappointing, I may never watch another Villeneuve film again.

There is really not much point in me saying much about the story. It should be well known for any science fiction fan and it is a great story and really good material for a big screen movie despite some “critics” at Rotten Tomatoes moaning about it and calling it unwieldly etc. Probably too big a book with too many words for the small, agenda driven, brains of Rotten Tomatoes “critics”. No surprise there. The movie as a whole is wonderful to watch, the scenery is oftentimes very beautiful and the décor, the buildings, the machinery is very well done. I was surprised that the world of Caladan was portrayed as a rather austere Scottish looking landscape but after getting over the initial surprise it worked very well actually. I also like that the Harkonnen, especially the Baron, are not turned into some exaggerated comical figures but, although disgusting and despicable, they are actual humans. Overall the casting was quite good and everyone played their roles well. At the beginning I felt that Paul was a bit too wimpy, from what I remember of the book he was quite well trained and skilled already from the start, but he picked up as the movie went along. It is a science fiction, borderline fantasy, movie so there should be some special effects, right? This is a difficult movie to make special effects for since this universe is a weird mix between futuristic science fiction, fantasy elements and old-fashioned traditions. I have to say that they succeeded quite well though. The atmosphere felt just right, ships, spice harvesters, buildings looked cool and fitting the story. The way they implemented the personal shields was very nice. They didn’t go overboard on special effects and weird designs. The ornithopter was of course totally ridiculous from a scientific point of view but at least it looked pretty cool.

The story ofDuneis incredibly deep, there are so many layers of political factions and relationships that it can get quite confusing at times. I had to constantly be looking up specific individuals and their ties to each other to understand the minor nuances of the story. Despite that fact, Villeneuve is still able to deliver a coherent narrative that will allow the majority of the audience to understand the overarching plot. After the buildup of the first act, the story gets cooking, and I was utterly invested. There is an incredible atmosphere present in this film. It begins as a Sci-Fi epic, following a house starting anew on a fresh planet and a new industry to conquer. You can feel the optimism and the sense of discovery in the shots due to the interesting angles, lighting, and a brilliant soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer. But as the narrative evolves so does the tone, as a thick fog of helplessness bleeds on to the screen and you can feel the dread form. This tone was quite refreshing in today’s blockbuster cinema, as each movie needs to incorporate a vast amount of unnecessary comedy to appeal to the broader audience. Dune is unapologetic about what the story is trying to deliver and gives you exactly what it wants without any concessions. The visuals are stunning throughout the entire runtime. One of my favorite scenes was during the spice extraction visit. I loved the blend of realism that was used in this Science Fiction setting. The ships and equipment look like they could exist in our own world with a few technological advancements. The fight choreography is really well done, especially the hand-to-hand combat. The final scene was epic, each fist and punch were so sharp and calculated, it was really impressive to watch in the age of jump cut action. The acting is perfect throughout the film, I really cannot point to any one character that felt off or out of place. Timothee Chalamet did an incredible job as the lead man. He delivered a heartfelt performance and evolved throughout the entire film into the confident leader the story crashendos on. Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, and Josh Brolin all did great jobs as well. I really brought the somewhat complex nature of Lady Jessic and Duke Leto, they had really great chemistry with themselves and with their son. Stellan Skarsgard had my favorite performance of the entire film. I felt entirely disgusted everytime he was on the screen, and he made the hairs on the back of my neck stand tall. He is truly a man poisoned by greed and will not stop at anything on his path to fortune. Jason Momoa does a fantastic job here too. I felt he really fit his role and his lines were delivered effortlessly, much better than his performance in the DCEU.

I walked into the theater without much knowledge of the story, which left me a bit confused at the start. However, as the movie progressed, it felt like a mix of Star Wars and Tremors, which was intriguing. Timothée Chalamet is one of my top three favorite actors, and he didn't disappoint in this film. Alongside him, Rebecca Ferguson delivered a stellar performance, portraying a queen-like character with grace. The movie boasted an impressive cast from various backgrounds, adding depth to the story. Visually, the film was stunning, with planes resembling dragonflies and captivating scenes. Yet, I found it challenging to follow the plot entirely, leaving me with many unanswered questions. While enjoyable to watch, it lacked a clear setup for a potential sequel, which was a bit disappointing. Zendaya's role, heavily promoted, turned out to be minimal, which may disappoint fans. On the other hand, seeing Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista in different roles was refreshing, showcasing their versatility as actors. The portrayal of Chalamet as a Jesus-like figure felt a bit forced but didn't overshadow the overall experience. Despite its flaws, I believe Dune has the potential to evolve into a successful franchise if given the chance. While it may not have matched the wow factor of some other first films in franchises, it's worth a watch for its cinematic experience. I'd rate it a six out of ten, with Chalamet and Ferguson stealing the show with their stellar performances. In conclusion, Dune is a movie worth watching, especially on the big screen. It has the elements to become a long-lasting franchise, but its success ultimately depends on audience reception. Give it a chance and see for yourself the potential this film holds."", 'most_watched_genres': []}]",100,Yes! Looking good!

It’s also marred by some blatant predictableness, like Leonard’s name on the bench and the “cup of coffee” aspect. Still, this is a tale that needed to be told and I’m not sorry I watched it. It’s just overrated. The film runs 2 hours and was shot in Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, New York City.

Amin recounts his dramatic story through his own words, beginning when he was a young boy in Afghanistan in the 1980s to his incredible journey that made him the man he is today. The hand-drawn animation is a poetic way to not only tell the man’s story, but to protect his identity. Amin’s life, of which most of it has been spent on the run, is recounted in a series of unbelievable events that are traumatic, heartbreaking, and inspiring. That all of these things happened to one man and he’s still standing is a testament to a human’s will to survive, and I hoped he would eventually get his happy ending (you’ll have to watch the film to see if that happens). Rasmussen has an empathy towards his subject that’s crucial to making this thoughtful documentary work. Amin feels comfortable opening up to him, and reliving so many painful memories about the horrors he and his family experienced during his lifetime gives the film a very somber tone. From his parents resorting to human trafficking so their kids could have the opportunity to get an education to the sadness of leaving his homeland for Russia during a time of unrest in Kabul, this refugee story spans more than a decade and examines the long-term psychological effects of a lifetime spent running away from oppression and towards freedom. “Flee” is a personal history brought to life, and Amin eventually reveals a secret that he’s never told another soul. It’s a cathartic exercise of a man confronting his painful past so he can move ahead to a brighter future, and his quest to find a place he can finally call home.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 31), ('Comedy', 31), ('Thriller', 30), ('Action', 27), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'badelf', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'I lovedEVERYTHINGabout this film.

Her initial reaction to the climate and awkward way of behaving shows us that she has Asperger\'s Syndrome and/or autism. Asperger\'s is a milder form of autism, where the subject has better communication skills like speech, but is still unable to connect with our view of normal behavior. Temple grows to love the ranch, working with the animals and inventing an automatic gate that can be opened with the pull of a brass rod. She is very smart and detail-oriented, but must go to college. Temple\'s mother Eustacia (Julia Ormond, also maturing nicely into character roles) has been dealing with Temple\'s outbursts all of her life, and knows what it takes to calm Temple down. Unfortunately, college life is tough for Temple, who builds a machine that calms her but horrifies other students (it\'s a version of a cattle hold). Temple is thrown into this collegiate setting in the days before special services, yet she manages to make it through, and goes on to get her master\'s degree in animal husbandry back in Arizona. Again, Temple runs into obstacles- in the form of the cattlemen who don\'t want her around studying such silliness as what the cows\' mooing mean- plus she is a woman, and they just aren\'t allowed. Temple designs and implements a new way to send cattle through a medicinal dip that is more humane to them, and then goes about rethinking the way cattle are slaughtered. Temple feels that animals were put on this earth for the service of man, but there is no reason we cannot be kind to them as part of their use as food and other products, and it makes good business sense. Temple is headstrong, but she does not see the world like you and I do. She sees everything as a picture, and takes puns and jokes literally. When she hears the term ""animal husbandry,"" her mind calls up a person marrying an animal, and so on. Death is a foreign concept, too, for both animals and humans. When a major character dies, she wonders where they went, and doesn\'t understand saying goodbye to them at a funeral, since she just told them goodbye when she saw them last. Somehow, Grandin went on to write for technical ranching journals, before becoming an autistic advocate, and the screenplay is based on two books- both of which she authored. Mick Jackson\'s direction is fantastic. Using special effects appropriately, he shows the viewer how Grandin is able to picture things in her mind. These scenes are a great learning experience without overwhelming the screen with technical wizardry, and tell us that autistics are not mentally deficient; they are different, not less (a line from Temple\'s mother). While the screenplay jumps back and forth in time too often (college, and then boarding high school?), it does not lose its focus on Grandin. While the supporting cast gets to use their onscreen time, the film has one central character who is fascinating enough to watch without any melodramatic gristle to get in the way. O\'Hara is great as Aunt Ann, who knows her niece so well. Her reassuring phone calls and scenes with Temple\'s worried mom are well-played. Ormond is phenomenal as Temple\'s mother. I could completely associate with her, watching her offspring doing something strange, and blaming themselves for their child\'s condition. Eustacia is no screaming battleaxe, telling everyone where to stick their assorted diagnoses. She has the patience of a saint, deciding to teach Temple to speak with flash cards, and hesitantly accepting that her child is not able to show love and affection. David Strathairn is also wonderful as Temple\'s science professor at the boarding school, recognizing that Temple is brilliant if the coursework is changed to fit her learning style. Claire Danes is a revelation. She has been simply good in ""Romeo + Juliet"" and the third ""Terminator"" film, but her googly-eyed emoting in the overrated ""My So-Called Life"" drove me batty. I have seen interviews with the real Temple Grandin, and Danes doesn\'t just do a good job, or master some observed mannerisms, she becomes Temple Grandin. She nails it from the very first scene, and consistently got it right. The viewer doesn\'t need someone to come out and explain every one of Temple\'s quirks; her fear of automatic doors and lashing out physically when she feels threatened are all embodied by Danes. She is so good, I forgot I was watching a performance. This is one of the best pieces of acting I have ever seen, and I have been reviewing films in one way or another since elementary school. I loved ""Temple Grandin."" I could associate with it thanks to a family situation, but many more can find inspiration here. Not only will Temple\'s story inspire autistics and their families, this work might demonstrate to emerging artists what a powerful medium film can be.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Horror', 28), ('Drama', 27), ('Comedy', 27), ('Thriller', 25), ('Other', 122)]}]",100,Yes!

Though the great auteur lived on another 25 years and even wrote and directed some smaller projects, Fanny and Alexander can still be seen as a great capstone to decades of legendary cinema. FANNY AND Alexander deals with the great two preoccupations of Bergman's career, namely the absence of God and the unbridgeable gaps between human beings, but the result is wonderfully life-affirming. Fanny and Alexander are the children of Oscar and Emilie Ekdahl, actors in Uppsala circa 1907, but the film gives a panorama of the extended Ekdahl family, presided over by grandmother Helena, uncles Gustav Adolf (a restaurateur and the film's most comedic presence) and Carl (a professor who has fallen into debt and is trapped in a loveless marriage), their wives and children, and the selfless Jewish shopkeeper Isak Jacobi. This Swedish family lives in an Old World opulence that is hard to believe for audiences today, especially for a country whose class system by and large disappeared after the war. The rigid interaction among people not closely acquainted and the deference of servants to their employers make for gestures as alien to us 21st century viewers as a Noh play. In a way, Fanny and Alexander is like those big novels of a century ago, by Tolstoy or Galsworthy, dealing with the vicissitudes of a whole family. The vaster family drama, however, is only a backdrop to a more personal one: Fanny and Alexander are soon orphaned, and their widowed mother eventually remarries, this time with a cruel clergyman. The children move from the freedom and comfort of the Ekdahl home to the austere bishop's place, where the children are punished for the slightest infraction by beatings or being locked up in the attic. The Ekdahls' torment living under the bishop is the great crisis of the film, and their unexpected liberation from it presents Alexander with a burden that he will carry into his budding manhood. The original television version is the way to see Bergman's final masterpiece. Don't be daunted by the length: 5 hours should not be a problem in an age when people will watch an entire season of a sitcom in one sitting. Fanny and Alexander is not slow, meditative cinema like, say, Andrei Tarkovsky or Béla Tarr, but rather Bergman is always presenting the viewer with some engaging little drama. The theatrical cut, which Bergman made only with the greatest regret, is a very different (and much weaker film), cutting out much of the film's magical realism, the touching meditations on growing old represented by the character of the grandmother, and some vivid depictions of early 20th-century Sweden."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 78), ('Comedy', 27), ('Romance', 22), ('Documentary', 13), ('Other', 53)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'The eponymous children (Pernilla Allwin and Bertil Guve) live an happy upper-middle class life with their theatre-manager father ""Oskar"" (Allan Edwall) and mother ""Emilie"" (Ewa Fröling) and are looking forward to Christmas. Parties ensue and a good time is had by all until the father is suddenly taken ill. His death follows swiftly and their mother is soon being wooed by the rather puritanical bishop ""Vergerus"" (Jan Malmsjö) who has a rather different, more disciplinarian, attitude to bringing up the children. When they marry, the life of ""Alexander"", especially, becomes nigh on intolerable. ""Emilie"" is initially tolerant of her new husband\'s policies, but gradually she grows to hate him and to start finding a way to get herself and her children back the safety of her own, loving, family. It\'s slightly episodic, this film. Phase one shows us the happiness, the second the marriage, the third - well that\'s the escape from the marriage - and it\'s the second phase that works best for me. A really quite chilling performance from Malmsjö as the cruel man of God also brings out a spirited effort from the young Guve who proves that ""Alexander"" is definitely not a quitter. The design of this film contrasts well the relative, red-velvet, luxury of their original home with the austerity of the bishop\'s much more sparse and chilled residence - and of that comparative change in their familial dynamic. Daniel Bell provides us with a score that accompanies the ups and downs of these two children, and increasingly of their mother, well too. Fröling\'s is another robust contribution - we can sense her character\'s infuriating frustration as she realises that it\'s a man\'s world, and she is largely trapped by her husband\'s status and subject to his will. It\'s a bit of a slow starter this, Bergman takes his time introducing us to characters that have varying degrees of tangentiality to the ultimate thread, but it does ultimately create the feeling that this is a family, a community - and some of the pieces starts to fit nicely as we head to the denouement. That conclusion? Well, I rather liked that! It\'s best on a big screen this film.

But Jake is a solid protagonist, even somewhat sympathetic despite the curious things he does. By the middle of the second act I found myself getting bored with the story and trying to figure out what was going on, but the film perks up in the last act, particularly when it reveals the truth about the scary bunny guy. After viewing, my overall impression was that the story never really took off and was burdened by perplexing ambiguities even while possessing some fascinating elements. I came up with a theory to explain the events (explained below) but, upon reflection, I realized that all the pieces didn\'t fit. And the movie simply wasn\'t entertaining enough to bang my head further trying to figure it out. I would\'ve given the movie a mediocre 5/10 rating, but after investigating the official meaning and the alternative explanations I had to admit that the film is genius in this respect. It just needed to be attached to a more interesting story with more stimulating characters. The film runs 113 minutes, which is the version I saw; the Director\'s Cut runs 20 minutes longer. It was shot in Los Angeles and surrounding areas (Angeles National Forest, Long Beach, Santa Monica, Santa Clarita, Burbank & Calabasas). GRADE: B- ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY (SPOILER ALERTDon\'t read unless you\'ve seen the movie): My casual interpretation turned out to be one of the alternative explanations of the movie, the so-called ""Donnie Is Shown the Future"" explanation, which suggests that Donne is shown the future via the future ghost of Frank and so he sacrifices himself at the end to save everyone. But, as noted above, there are too many holes in this interpretation. A couple of other popular explanations are the banal Schizophrenia Theory, where the film shows the protagonist going through an episode of his illness, and the Dream Theory, where it was ""all just a dream,"" which is too clichéd and idiotic to even consider. The \'official\' interpretation I would\'ve never pieced together because it\'s just too sci-fi-oriented and complex: It\'s the Tangent Universe Theory, which suggests that time in the Primary Universe (i.e. reality) is occasionally corrupted and an unstable alternative universe is created, but it will only last a few weeks. Nevertheless, it threatens to destroy the universe. The events you see happening in the bulk of the film are this alternative reality where the universe (or God) is correcting the error to get back to the Primary Universe using an Artifact (the jet engine), The Living Receiver (Jake Gyllenhaal), a Manipulated Dead person (the bunny guy), and so on.

Directed and written by Richard Kelly, it stars a young Jake Gyllenhaal and offers us a very complex plot where a young teenager commits several crimes under the influence of an imaginary friend who dresses up as a rabbit. Everything indicates that this young man is schizophrenic or psychotic in some way, and has developed several linked obsessions, but the film always leaves us in doubt as to whether he is, in some way, right about the things he thinks. There are several films that follow similar scripts, where imagination and psychopathy are almost indistinguishable from reality (“Fight Club”, “Machinist”, etc.) and this is perhaps one of the most surreal because it allows us to see, from the beginning, that something is very wrong. That's a bonus for those who like these types of films because it's easy to keep our attention. Of course, those who are less fond of cinematic oddities won't have much reason to be satisfied. And if it is true that, on a technical level, the film does not present any major innovations or surprises, it is also true that it does everything very correctly and without problems or gross errors.

Sparse of dialogue, this is a masterstroke decision by director Jean-Pierre Melville, because what chat there is makes us hang on every word being spoken. It also re-enforces the loneliness essence of the hit-man's life. Jef's apartment is so bland and devoid of personality, the only thing of beauty there is a bird in a cage, the metaphor of such is hard to ignore. Jef himself is beautiful, he also is perpetually in an emotionally frozen cage. Attired in trenchcoat and fedora hat (or is it a trilby?), it's obvious that Delon and Melville are homaging with great respect the American film noir classic cycle. It's also quite amazing that although the film is technically filmed in colour, it still feels like one of those black and white noirs of the 40s and 50s. There's a coldness to Henri Decaë's (Ascenseur pour l'échafaud/Elevator to the Gallows) photography that so befits the story, the interiors are stripped of life, the exteriors almost always gloomy. And with the brilliant Delon as cool as an Eskimo's wedding tackle, icy veneers are all the rage here. Hugely influential, Le Samouraï deserves every plaudit that has come its way. Best thing about it is that it actually gets better on a repeat viewing, because the surreal edge disappears the next time and in its place is an awareness of what the director is doing, and with that comes an appreciation of great film noir film making.

Jef Costello (Alain Delon) is given a contract to kill a nightclub owner, but on the way out he is seen by the club's pianist (Cathy Rosier) and then gets himself picked up in a police sweep. He finds himself pursued by both a cunning detective (François Périer) and by his disappointed employers. As the film progresses, Costello manages to elude both threats while remaining true to his bushido-like code of honour. The strongest aspect of Le Samouraï, I feel, is Alain Delon's performance. Beginning with an utterly stoic mien and confidence, Costello gradually loses his cool over the course of the film, and Delon skillfully depicts this subtle collapse. Melville's direction is remarkable for its ability to sustain suspense (even across multiple viewings, when one already knows how it will go down), and it's curious how the audience is led to sympathy for this man who is basically a cold-blooded murderer. We are even denied a back story that might serve as an apology for his profession. Instead, Costello is just a robotic killing machine, but the film makes us feel concern for him nonetheless. There is also memorable soundtrack by François de Roubaix, an early example of electronic music. Some aspects of the policework are presented in a clunky or unbelievable fashion (the detective has memorized every building in Paris, seriously?), so I cannot rate this as a flawless masterpiece. But still, it's a good film, and part of the basic education of a cinephile: Le Samouraï has proved vastly influential in the decades since its release, and those who have seen more recent films like Jim Jarmusch's Ghost Dog or Michael Mann's Collateral will recognize various aspects of those to be hommages to Melville's classic.

And if they\'re lapping up their own vomit, the only way to stop them is with a lash. A sparse soundstage is stylishly utilized to create a minimalist small-town setting in which a mysterious woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) hides from the criminals who pursue her. The town locals at first decide to shield Grace, and in return she openly works labour tasks for them to work off her gratitude. It\'s not long, however, before the residents of Dogville begin to show their true teeth... One thing is an absolute, Lars Von Trier knows how to push the buttons of critics and movie lovers alike. Dogville proved to be a case in point, a film that saw some high profile film critics renounce the director as anti American - even anti human, while others lauded the ""Great Dane"" as a visionary and a director of bravura panache. The point is, and it\'s a fact, there is no guarantee that Dogville will hit the spot of every first time viewer venturing in for the challenge. As it happens, I\'m very much in the plus camp here, to me it\'s not only brave in style of production, but also it\'s narratively as caustic as anything so called ""anti human"" directors like Kubrick, Godard etc ever produced. The bareness of the sound stage setting, where we can see the workings of all residents of Dogville going about their respective business, very much shows there is no hiding place, all the bile strewn movements/ignorance is laid bare for all to see, we are all complicit. There\'s an outstanding cast assembled, fronted by Kidman (never more beautiful and never better as an actress), with support coming from Paul Bettany, Stellan Skarsgård, Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Patricia Clarkson, James Caan, Philip Baker Hall and others who give their all for their director. It\'s often charged that Trier is a misogynist, personally I don\'t see it that way, more so as Dogville reaches its crushing climax. This easily could have been shaved of 20 minutes from the run time, but it has to be said that Von Trier doesn\'t waste a single frame here. Roll your dice and take your chance, you will either love it or hate it, or admire or admonish, what isn\'t in doubt is that you will never ever forget watching Dogville. 9/10', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 43), ('Thriller', 42), ('Crime', 34), ('Action', 29), ('Other', 111)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'I reckon this is my favourite Lars Von Trier film.

When I decided to see this film, I did it for three reasons: the first is the participation of Bruno Ganz, a German actor that I appreciate and that I started to like after seeing him do excellent work in other films such as “The Fall”; the second is the enormous consideration in which this film has been held by a very high number of distinguished critics and specialists; the third is the fact that it's the first West German film I've seen in my life (as far as I know and that I'm aware of). The script, however, couldn't be more tasteless than it turns out to be: the film begins with the turns and wanderings of two angels through the streets and places of West Berlin, observing people's daily lives. Damiel and Cassiel, each in their own way, are interested in human beings. They cannot be seen, except for children, and for a single individual who manages to talk to them, and one of them ends up deciding to become a human being and live a mortal life, on Earth, after falling in love with a woman. circus trapeze artist. In fact, there is no lack of television or literary material about angels who fall in love with humans or who, for other reasons, give up their angelic life and become humans. It seems that there is, among us, a desire to humanize these creatures. In the wake of all this, the film makes a series of philosophical and metaphysical considerations that will only truly interest philosophers, or theologians, or writers in general. Wim Wenders is a director who appreciates this type of ultra-intellectual cinema, made for artistic cycles and festivals, never for the general public, who find it a good substitute for sleeping pills. Personally, I don't like this type of cinema, even though I recognize its artistic merit. Bruno Ganz, on his journey, awakens to the beauty of humanity in an elegant way that borders on poetry. He sees beauty in the most trivial things, which we usually don't, not without an extreme artistic sensitivity that the common individual rarely cultivates. The actor couldn't be more competent in the work he does, and is skilfully assisted by Otto Sander, who has another angelic role. Solveig Dommartin and Peter Falk are also very good additions, with time to show value. The problem with this film is really the excessively slow and cold way in which it unfolds and gradually exposes itself. The pace of the film is so slow that it becomes boring, and I confess that I didn't pay much attention to the permanent monologues. Things improve a lot when Falk enters the scene, giving movement to a bloodless and soporific plot. The closing credits, in German expressionist style, make a direct allusion to the cinematographic past of the city, and of the country, something that Wenders may have done as a tribute, or asserting himself as a continuer of the legacy of the past (which is not as modest as the first idea). Almost the entire film is shot in black-and-white, with cinematography that is very well achieved and worthy of merit. Colors are introduced later, becoming more associated with humanity, that is, with the way we see the world we live in. Original, well thought out. The film does not have a great soundtrack, betting more on monologues and very boring dialogues. Furthermore, the film is practically a city tour of West Berlin, a metropolis that has changed radically in recent years, as we know. The wall is there, even though it was purposely built for the movie and is not the real thing."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}]",100,Yes!

It has been probably twenty years since my family had any sort of cross-generational repast, and there are certainly parts of this that ring true as the personalities of all concerned - even the youngsters - start to impose themselves on the ordinarily structured lives of all gathered together. That brings an authenticity to the scenario. There are no fights, tantrums, or squabbles - but it is clear from our observations that there are soft, vulnerable, points in each of their characters and that all of them are looking to the future in differing (and shorter-term) ways. Kirin Kiki - the mother - probably steals this for me, but the remainder of the ensemble cast deliver a touching, challenging and personal story with surety and delicacy.

It stars Joan Fontaine, Louis Jordan, Mady Christians, Art Smith and Howard Freeman. Music is by Daniele Amfitheatrof and cinematography by Franz Planer. Masterpiece, the very definition of classic cinema is right here, a film that is both beautiful and tragic, a piece of cinema that’s crafted with such great skill by all involved it’s hard to believe some critics turned their noses up at it back on its original release. Story is set in Vienna at the turn of the century and finds Lisa Berndle (Fontaine) as a teenager who has a crush on one of the neighbours in her apartment complex. That neighbour is concert pianist Stefan Brand (Jourdan), but Lisa will not get to know Stefan until some years later, and then only briefly, yet true love never dies does it? The scene is set right from the off, the superb set designs of period Vienna come lurching out of the screen. Jordan stands straight backed and handsome, and then Fontaine a picture of angelic beauty. Ophuls brings his euro eye for details and flair to the party, his camera work fluid, yet compact, personal but still a distant and caustic observer to the corruptible folly of romantic obsession. And Planer mists up the photogenics as Amfitheatrof drifts delicate and dramatic sounds across the unfolding drama. Narratively most of the picture is played out in the past, showing how Stefan Brand come to be reading a heart aching letter from a woman who loved and adored him. Not that he would know, such was his life of womanising and narcissistic leanings. Oh he could romance the best of them, charm a snake out of the basket, but quite frankly he’s a cad, and a coward to boot. Maybe this letter from the unknown woman will shake him out of his self centred world? Give him a chance at redemption? Or maybe not… The characterisation of Lisa Berndle (Fontaine simply magnificent) is stunning in its coldness. This is a woman who for the briefest of moments in her life, derails her shot at potential happiness, and the stability afforded her son, in the belief that Stefan Brand is the destined love of her life, that love will find a way. Her foolish obsession borders on insanity, she’s so driven by a self-destructive persona she can’t see this is no fairytale. There is much beauty on show, but the devilish hand of fate and some tragic realisations wait for the principal players here, Ophuls brilliantly blowing a blackened cloud over the culmination of tale.

A Chinese immigrant lives in America and embarks on a crazy and strange adventure in multiple universes. This movie should be called the multiverse of madness. The things that were written in ""Doctor Strange 2"" I saw in this movie in terms of the worlds, the characters, and the strange things that happen. Critics expressed their admiration for this film and it won the admiration of many, but from my point of view, yes, it was enjoyable, but the duration of the movie was unpleasant and long for me. There is a good message in the movie, which is an atmosphere that contains a rush about oneself and how important we are in this universe, at the same time you discover that you aren\'t important in this universe. There is a strong emotional factor in the movie, which is the story of a mother with her daughter and the love of the family, but the film sometimes took unexpected comedic paths and was affected by the emotional factor. At the same time, there are things that are supposed to be funny and they actually made many viewers of the film laugh, but at the same time you see Some of the comedy scenes were disgusting and nauseating.

Here you see the idea is similar, but in multiple universes, and you see these multiple universes and you see the options. This movie makes you think about your personal decisions and makes you think that there are people like you, but in other universes they made decisions that affected you. Here this idea is creative, but what bothered me was the comedic situations at the wrong time. There are emotional scenes that were touching. Great dialogue scenes, but they were damaged by the comedy because sometimes the movie Reminds me of Marvel movies. The cinematography, editing, and music were wonderful, which was an essential factor in the film\'s story. The scene of the rocks was eye-catching, wonderful, deep and poignant, but at the same time the director decided to show this story and how he used somewhat disgusting comedic tools.

I just saw this film and felt an irresistible need to talk about it and comment on it. However, I recognize that a text of just a few thousand characters is completely insufficient to make a fair assessment. This is one of the most complex films I've seen, and so I'm going to try to make an extra effort not to spoil it, even though I feel like I'm going to need to address some things in more depth to be able to write what I need. Let's start by saying that the film was an overwhelming success, both at the box office and with critics, and that it is worth every cent of our cinema ticket. He was also acclaimed at the 2023 Oscars ceremony, with seven statuettes (Best Film, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay) in ten nominations. And in addition to the Oscars, many other prizes and awards that seem completely justified to me. The script is one of the most creative and insane I've ever seen: it all starts with a middle-aged Chinese lady who tries to deal with the organized chaos of her normal life: a half-bankrupt business, a marriage in ruins, a bad relationship with an authoritarian father and a lesbian and protesting daughter. And problems with income tax. It is in the midst of this that she discovers that there are billions of other universes, with several other versions of the people she knows, and that she needs to help defeat an evil, an evil force that threatens to destroy them all. The film starts from very bold physics premises, where there are some theories that address the possibility of universes parallel to ours, with our alter-egos living there, and goes further, stating that these universes are born from our multiplicity of options and decisions every day. For example, I'm here writing this, but in another universe, another version of me chose not to watch any movie and sleep. I'm not going to explain much more, not even how the main character discovers this, nor what kind of evil entity that is, but I can say that, deep down, the biggest message I took away from this film is the need to live in the present, but also have faith and cultivate love and good feelings, instead of futile sensations or meaningless nihilism. In effect, the main character needs to believe in herself and in the abilities she doesn't know she can have, in order to combat that malevolent force, which is, in itself, a good representation of nihilism, the feeling that nothing in this life it's really worth it. Still regarding the script, I believe it is fair to say that it was precisely closer to the end that I felt the inspiration running out, the creative overdose of the directors and screenwriters. This is, after so many bizarre and unusual things, the apparently simple ending (even though it wasn't) seemed strangely anti-climactic to me. There's so much to say about the technical aspects of this film... directed by Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan, it's a surprisingly cheap production (a budget of around thirty million dollars, for Hollywood and considering what this film is, it's a small bag of pennies and quarters), which works incredibly well. On a visual level, it's one of the most devastating films I've ever seen, with cinematography and editing worthy of being studied by film schools. And then, we have the great work of designing sets and costumes, and the impressive work of the action doubles and makeup, among many other subtle details that are so tiny that we almost don't notice them, and that show the detailed, patient nature and commitment of directors and their team. The soundtrack is also a very positive point, with an atmospheric and sometimes very discreet sound. There are lots of references to aspects of pop culture, such as martial arts or even technological gadgets, and the fight and action scenes were made with maximum attention to detail, including sudden stops of the image in the most intense scenes, a style of cinematography very characteristic of kung fu films. The work of the cast deserves praise. By playing a wide range of cinema styles in the same character, from comedy to physical action, Michelle Yeoh embarked on a tour de force so challenging that it would make any renowned actor think twice. The way she gives herself to the character is total, absorbing. Stephanie Hsu follows her closely and offers us profound work, full of feeling and emotion. Ke Huy Quan is also impressive and does a remarkable job. In smaller characters but still worthy of mention, we have the veteran James Hong, and the prestigious Jamie Lee Curtis, in a performance so far out of her comfort zone that it seems unimaginable for this actress, and yet it could become pivotal to her career from now on."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}, {'writer': 'cineast78', 'score': '40%', 'review': ""Bloated nonsense, overlong and meaningless. If this movie wasn't so overhyped and so overrated, I would just dismiss it as a meh kind of movie. But as it is so overhyped and overrated, I kind of start to hate it. But to not waste a lot more time on this nonsense, I will just point out the main reasons why the movie failed for me. 1.) The movie failed to establish an emotional connection between the viewer and what is happening on the screen i. E. in the movie. One of the reasons for that being: the movie was driven by nonsense. Whenever the main characters are stuck in a situation, the have to perform some nonensical bullcrap, so that they can crazy-deus-ex-machina their way out of the situation. Again and again and again and again and again. 2.) The other reason for the failed emotional connection is that there were no sympathetic characters given to connect with. Everyone is just a self-absorbed a-hole or douchebag. What they are fighting for is a chaotic piled up mess (because they are unable to fix anything and to improve, so they prefer having a meanignless mess to having nothing). So, my main problem was: I just didn't care for anything happening in the movie. If you think that it is a profound philosophical question to ask how your life would be if you would have sausages for fingers (just to give you an example), this may be a movie you. But if you think that such a question is just stupid and stopped being funny since you turned 8 years old, maybe you should avoid spending timeor money on this movie. But there are some few reddeming qualities of this movie, hence I gave it 4/10. Which are: The cinematography isn't bad. It doesn't look like a trash movie production-value-wise. Some of the acting wasn't too bad, if you can look past the garbage mess the actors had to work with. It has some funny moments, if you can take the nonsense and the stupidity.

The Ten Commandments is at the top end of Hollywood historical epics. It was to be Cecil B.

The story cribs from a number of biblical sources, some of which are hokum and not to be taken as a religio lesson, but basically it tells the tale of Moses (Charlton Heston) and how he came to lead the Israelites to their exodus from Egypt - culminating in his delivering of God\'s own Ten Commandments to the people. No expense is spared, with a top line ensemble cast being joined by over 25,000 extras. The wide-screen special effects work dazzles the eyes, the direction of ginormous crowd sequences impressive, and an ebullient spectacle is never far away in what is a picture running at three hours thirty minutes (add ten for the glory of an intermission). It would have been easy for the cast to get lost amongst such a large scale production, but the principals shine bright and make telling characteristic marks. Heston was born for the Moses role, Yul Brynner absolutely excels as Moses\' silky and sulky nemesis - Rameses, Anne Baxter gives Nefretiri a beauteous and villainous twin arc, which in turn is counterpointed by Yvonne De Carlo\'s sultry yet homely Sephora (wife of Moses). Elsewhere we get Debra Paget filling out a trio of gorgeous lady stars, where as Lilia she does determined and heartfelt oomph as a woman yearning to be freed from male dominance. Edward G. Robinson (Dathan) and Vincent Price (Baka) camp it up and have a good time, while Cedric Hardwicke (Sethi) turns in a heartfelt old Pharaoh and John Derek as Joshua, Moses\' underling, does surprisingly well given the enormity of the character trajectory.

As good a gangster movie that has ever been made as DePalma does justice to Mamet\'s electric script. The acting on show is right out of the top draw, the inevitable ease that DeNiro puts menace into Capone is quite impressive, whilst the fresh faced pugnacious tenacity of Andy Garcia\'s George Stone is something of a delightful experience. Yet that is not enough because we still need the central actors to carry the film if it is going to triumph. Connery is a given performance wise (accent aside of course, but then again who cares when the character portrayal is as sharp as it is here?) but it is Costner as Eliot Ness that shines like the star he was soon to become, it\'s a magic performance that manages to fuse genuine tenderness of family love with little trips to the dark side in pursuit of making good triumph over evil. I love that the film is showing how violence and fear affects families, mother and child is a theme that is central to the film\'s heartbeat, notice how some of the more violent scenes are followed by tender scenes of Ness and his family. The set pieces here are attention grabbing entertainment, a roaring Canadian border rumpus and a smashing roof top pursuit and face off are top value, but it\'s DePalma gold watching a brilliant Battleship Potemkin homage at the Union train station that takes the cake as the film enters the last quarter.

One of my 2020\'s resolutions is to review older films, classics that I never wrote about, and maybe go through a director\'s filmography before his/her next big movie. I\'ll also try to review previous films inside a franchise, for example, before the live-action Mulan is released, I\'ll definitely rewatch and review the 1998\'s original. You get my point. The Untouchables is one of those classics I\'ve already seen a few times, but I can\'t quite recall the last time I watched it, so it almost felt like a whole new release since I didn\'t remember most plot points. I really enjoyed experiencing such a great period gangster movie again. The cast is incredible, and I\'ll get there, but I need to start with the impressive production level for a 1987\'s flick. From the set design to the well-crafted action sequences, everything looks and feels like Chicago during the Prohibition Era. I love how the dialogues are played out. Nowadays, it\'s not that common to have an entire film filled with long, uncut conversations between the characters. Most directors just employ the unimaginative ""line-cut-line"" type of dialogue. I\'m not the biggest fan of Brian DePalma, even though he started one of my favorite action sagas of all-time (Mission: Impossible). However, his blocking/framing skills are outstanding in this movie. Every actor\'s movement is followed seamlessly by the camera (DP: Stephen H. Burum), making every single shot count. The screenplay is very well-structured. Every time the film starts lacking energy, something impactful occurs. A great action scene, a new story development that changes the course of the narrative, or a character\'s decision that makes the viewer worried about an inevitable outcome. Consequently, The Untouchables rarely loses its momentum, it\'s always entertaining in some shape or form. The four characters that constitute the title group are all emotionally compelling, and their actors offer extraordinary performances... except for the lead, Kevin Costner. I don\'t know if people might consider this a hot take or not, but I find Costner\'s display extremely one-dimensional. During the movie, he goes through life-threatening situations, people that he cares about die, and he eventually gets face-to-face with Al Capone. His facial expression looks awkwardly almost identical in all of these scenes, and many more. It\'s his first big film, the one that catapulted him into stardom, but I\'m not the first to find his acting rangeless in this flick. Nevertheless, it doesn\'t become that big of a distraction that I can\'t connect with his character. Regarding the rest of the cast, Sean Connery steals the show with his portrayal of Jim Malone. He\'s charming and funny, but when he needs to take his character through a very dark and dramatic scene, he has no problems in delivering an exceptional performance. The young Andy Garcia (George Stone) proves that he had the chops to become a great actor (which he did), and Charles Martin Smith is surprisingly witty as Oscar Wallace. My main issue with the movie involves the lack of screentime given to Robert De Niro as Al Capone. Sure, it\'s a story about the people who got the famous gangster, and not a biography of the latter. However, not only it\'s a waste of a phenomenal actor, but also a waste of a potentially great character. Al Capone is supposedly a quite clever businessman and ruthless crime boss, possessing an unusually well-protected organization, but he only appears in a few scattered scenes, like he\'s just some random villain that the good guys need to defeat. Granted, they\'re really cool scenes, but he doesn\'t feel like the massive threat that the film assumes he is since the viewer barely gets to know Al Capone and how he holds so much power. All in all, The Untouchables still holds up incredibly well after more than thirty years. Production-wise, not only the sets and costumes seamlessly resemble the Prohibition Era, but Brian DePalma\'s technically impressive blocking and framing are a joy to watch. Long, captivating, uncut dialogues are elevated by a remarkable cast (Sean Connery is undoubtedly the standout), despite Kevin Costner lacking a bit of emotional range. Even the action sequences of this 1987\'s movie look better than a lot of blockbusters of today. David Mamet writes a well-structured screenplay that rarely loses interest and featuring exceptionally compelling characters. Addictive score from Ennio Morricone as well. However, both Robert De Niro and his character, Al Capone, are underused, especially the latter. For such an important character who constantly changes the path of the narrative, the lack of screentime doesn\'t allow the viewer to understand Al Capone\'s motivations or feel how much of a threat he truly is. Still, it\'s a classic worthy of a rewatch, and I definitely recommend it.

This Brian De Palma movie has several other good scenes, and arguably not a single bad one; it does have, however, a couple of scenes that don’t make a lick of sense — some of the good ones, even. The bat scene, in particular, is a lot of fun, but I still have no idea who the guy is that Al Capone (Robert De Niro) beats the ever-loving crap out of, nor what he did to deserve such fate (I’ve come across a few explanations on Internet, including what my best guess would be, but nothing that stands up to scrutiny). Of course, Al Capone personally and literally whacking some random asshole to death is as likely as Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) fatally pushing Frank Nitti (the diabolical Billy Drago) off of a roof — that is to say, not bloody likely; Nitti shot himself dead long after the events of the film (though in a possible nod to the historical facts, De Palma has Ness shooting a hole in Nitti’s hat; according to Wikipedia’s account of Nitti’s suicide, “The first shot fired by Nitti’s unsteady hand missed and passed through his fedora”). Now, historically inaccurate movies usually make me go ballistic; however, The Untouchables is not a history lesson — if anything, it’s a tall tale with a folk hero (and they don’t get any folksier than Costner) and an archetypal villain (and that’s as close to an answer as we’re going to get to the bat scene question; Capone does what he does For the Evulz). More importantly, the facts may have been tampered with, but the film’s moral compass always points towards true north, and it knows that dura lex sed lex.', 'most_watched_genres': []}]",100,Yes!

The narrative is linear, there aren’t any montages, and the story isn’t about criminals, gangsters, or Brits. Fans of Ritchie will absolutely still recognize his visual style (hello, overhead shots) and testosterone-fueled themes, but “The Covenant” is a more dramatic, mature, and restrained work from the legendary director. Set during the war in Afghanistan in 2018, the film tells the story of U.S. Army sergeant John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his local Afghan interpreter, Ahmed (Dar Salim). Called a traitor by his people for helping the Americans, Ahmed has volunteered to seek revenge against the Taliban that killed his son. He has also been promised visas for his service so his family can flee to safety in America. After a lethal ambush in the desert, Kinley is gravely injured by enemy fire. With his platoon gone, Ahmed refuses to leave a fellow soldier behind to die, so he drags Kinley through the mountainous terrain in order to get him back to the base for medical help. The film tells the story of their 100 mile journey, but then pivots to Kinley’s return to the United States. It’s months after he gets home that Kinley learns Ahmed and his family were not given safe passage as promised and, as a way to repay the debt he owes his friend, he returns to Afghanistan to retrieve them. It won’t be easy, because Ahmed has been placed at the top of the Taliban’s most wanted hit list. It’s a meaningful story of honor and brotherhood wrapped up in an intense wartime thriller. The story is told in three major acts, from the early days Ahmed and Kinley spent chasing IEDs, to their dangerous journey, to the red tape of getting a man what he’s owed. There are plenty of thrilling acting sequences throughout, and they will keep you on the edge of your seat. Ritchie has an extraordinary sense of timing and instincts for shooting action scenes, and the brutal, graphic wartime violence puts you in the be-or-be-killed survival mind of a front line solider. The director’s visual storytelling is terrific here, as he switches between handheld shots with uneven movements to dizzying aerial shots to sweeping tracking shots seamlessly within one action scene. It creates a greater sense of immediacy and danger, expressing the gravity of the situation at hand. Some of the scenes are so distressing that I found my heart pounding throughout, and Ritchie’s use of harsh close-ups adds to the intensity. There’s a lot of cat-and-mouse content that adds to the tension, but it doesn’t feel gimmicky because this is a film that is unafraid to kill off characters at any time (so don’t get too attached to anyone). Gyllenhaal and Salim make a dynamic onscreen duo, and both men have a natural chemistry that is the highlight of the film. Salim’s performance is dynamic and genuine, and Gyllenhaal proves yet again that he’s a formidable leading man. He’s in his natural habitat here, playing a rugged everyman with a non-threatening masculinity that gives him a broad, universal appeal. The performances from the supporting cast are also top-notch. The story is one of integrity, loyalty, and respect, and these men have an incredible amount of honor. Ahmed and Kinley are forced to make tough decisions, but they never shy away from doing the right thing, even when it’s the harder option. These guys are still combat killers and trained soldiers, but their friendship takes center stage. This is such a great story of brotherhood that you’ll wish it was true (sorry folks, this is a work of fiction). The film only makes a couple of missteps, and there are two major things that bothered me. First, the alpha male dialogue among the soldiers is openly homophobic. It’s laughed off and never challenged. I found this to be a bit problematic, but the way these guys talk is also likely accurate and authentic. Second, the grand finale shootout feels a bit like military propaganda, where the brawny American saviors must step in and become the heroes. It’s a sequence that’s thrilling, but feels stuffed in as a way to appease the hyper-patriotic “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” crowd. But here’s where it gets interesting: the film is also highly critical of the U.S. government and the heads of the military. The soldiers may have honor, but those at a higher level do not. The film offers a scathing criticism that applies to the many ways the U.S. abandons its veterans too, from dismissing allegations of sexual assault, making it difficult to obtain proper healthcare, crafting vague promises, and flat-out lying. It’s a profound theme that may be lost on the majority of audiences (but I hope not). “The Covenant” is an extremely well made wartime action film, and those looking for a thrill will find it. Go and enjoy the entertainment value, but don’t lose sight of the small, emotional story that’s at the heart of it all.

It ultimately makes all the right sounds about military honour and commitment, even when confronted by stubborn bureaucracy and indifference. That said, its only at the end, when you read the ""fine print"", (300+ interpreters and their families dead) you get to see the scope of the US\'s lack of commitment to those who collaborated with it, in Afghanistan. I guess the obvious elephant in the living room, is should the US have invaded in the first place? Looking at the facts, the answer is, of course, ""no"". So much of the misery and loss we see on the ground in this film, probably could have been avoided, had the US stuck to its own borders. The film itself is well made, well acted and directed. Its story does resonate in a humanistic context. The action is well developed too if not entirely convincing. I did a wry smile at how the so called ""bad guys"", as per usual, seem to be appalling shots. Even when well armed and in large numbers, at close range. Inn summary, well acted, directed, a heartfelt story and lots of mostly engaging action. That said, the historical reality is, the US were invaders in Afghanistan.

However, after this first act, the movie does slow down a bit, with a pretty substantial lull that lasted about 20 minutes in the middle of the film. It was not terrible, but something I definitely noticed. Performances were excellent, particularly from Dar Salim, who was a standout in the film.

That\'s what seems to have happened here, but once you\'re watching it turns out to be little better than a derivative vehicle for an unremarkable Jake Gyllenhaal who gets to tug at the heart strings on behalf of those vital interpreters (50,000 of them, apparently) who were abandoned to the Taliban when the allied forces quit Afghanistan. In this rather procedural effort, his guide ""Ahmed"" (Dar Salim) goes above and beyond to rescue his handler ""Kinley"" from ambush only to find that the American is flown home to safety, recuperation and a big steak on the barbecue. The latter man is left to reap the benefits of his sterling efforts by having a price on his head and so is forced to live in hiding. ""Kinley"" learns of this and decides that the man must be got out. After endless red tape seems determined to ensure that the promise made at the time to these folks to offer them fast-track American visas after the conflict was not going to be honoured any time soon, ""KInley"" decides he\'s going to have to take matters into his own hands. Remarkably, from his American home he manages to track down the elusive ""Ahmed"" and with the aid of a commercial extraction agency, funds a trip to get in and get his friend out. Aside from some serious plot plausibility issues, as action films go it\'s fine. The cinematography and pace work well to give us a sense of the danger and the relentlessness (and stealth) of the warfare that frequently nullifies the superior firepower of the visitors when faced with hostile terrain and efficient guerrilla warriors. Gyllenhaal does nothing for me here, though. He\'s just going through the motions, especially when required to actually act. He has become a rather one-dimensional performer (maybe it\'s the beard?) and though there is merit in Salim\'s performance as his character is allowed to mature a little by Guy Ritchie, I just felt that I\'d seen the film before and the underpinning moralisation was largely undermined by the predictability of the storyline.

Epic the way Ben-Hur was epic. It’s filmed on rare Ultra Panavision 70. The film crew altered Modern cameras to work with UP70. Quentin Tarantino knew there were two types of film viewers. Those who would see his film as he intended and those who would not. Tarantino isn’t an idiot and knows people will pirate his and watch it on devices he can’t control [Note 1]. To combat this Tarantino made a version of the film which requires viewing in a theatre. He did this with the 70mm roadshow production of The Hateful Eight. The roadshow production of The Hateful Eight is a great experience. I was born in 1981, after roadshow theatrical releases fell out of popularity so I’ve never experience a roadshow theatrical release. Roadshow theatrical releases were (or are) a limited engagement showing of a movie before general release. The Hateful Eight’s roadshow includes a beautifully produced souvenir program\u200a—\u200aalready available on Ebay. The lights go out fifteen minutes prior to the film starting and no previews are shown. Roadshows aren’t their to advertise. Their purpose is to wow you with The Hateful Eight in 70mm. I was only eleven when Reservoir Dogs was released and thirteen when Pulp Fiction was released. Arguably, a little too young to watch these films. Although I knew what sex was and how it worked, My young mind didn’t know about paraphilia or unusual sexual interests. I don’t think I even had a working idea of how homosexual sex worked. This would have made watching scenes from Pulp Fiction rather difficult for me at that age. [Note 2]\nUnlike many, I saw Reservoir Dogs before Pulp Fiction. Although I like the editing style of Pulp Fiction, I think Reservoir Dogs is a better film. What makes Reservoir Dogs great is the lack of financing. Financial constraints didn’t limit Tarantino and Reservoir Dogs is dialogue heavy with very impactful scenes revolving around a single location: The Warehouse. The high-level idea of The Hateful Eight, Quentin Tarantino’s Eighth film, which implies the title is deliberate, is about a bounty hunter escorting a prisoner (the only female in the film) to “hang by the neck until they are dead” in Red Rock. However, a blizzard prevents the prisoner from reaching the final location and the prisoner along with eight others are stuck in a single room: Minnie’s Haberdashery. The Hateful Eight is filmmaking at it’s finest. Like Reservoir Dogs it could have been a theatrical production. It didn’t have to be a movie. If there are special effects they aren’t noticeable. There is violence and blood, which you expect, but comparing to other Quentin Tarantino’s films it’s tame. There is no dancing to a radio tune while Michael Madsen conducts a horrific act. But, the strongest story-telling scene will stick with you. A flashback overlaid with a monologue performed by Samuel L. Jackson that demonstrates the artistic ability of Tarantino. The editing between Major Warren’s narrative and what General Smithers envisions can only be told with film. The scene contrasts the alluring story with the distasteful act. A compliment to the editor who doesn’t pull you out of the monologue, but enhances it.\nI’ve only seen, read, or heard a few interviews with Tarantino, but I don’t get the impression he does anything on accident. Tarantino puts too much thought into his ideas and works. When Bret Easton Ellis interviewed Tarantino he stated: My scripts are meant to be read.\n[The Bride] has stashed all this shit in the ground. So, she is going to dig a hole and pull up a footlocker and it will have passports, money, and weapons. All the things she will need for her revenge. But, the way I have it written in the script is she needs to find a rock and turn it over to find an ‘X’ on the rock. She turns over the rock and finds the ‘X’. If the ‘X’ hadn’t have been there or if she couldn’t have found rock, she would have taken it as a sign that her revenge never should happen and she would have dropped the whole idea. These are things you can’t show on film. You get this same type of feeling when watching The Hateful Eight. It is hard to imagine that Tarantino didn’t have a few one-on-one days with each actor explaining to their character’s fully-developed backstory which isn’t depicted in the film. Only additional viewings will explain each characters motives. Many of my college friends who enjoyed Kill Bill Volume One didn’t like Kill Bill Volume Two even though Kill Bill Volume Two is the stronger of the two films. The reason? The dialogue. The dialogue is the best part of The Hateful Eight. Although The Hateful Eight is three hours long you don’t feel it. The film engrosses you with the characters, their conversations, and the conflict between them. The acting is superb. My wife said that this is her favorite Quentin Tarantino film. I don’t know if I disagree and although Reservoir Dogs holds a special place with me, The Hateful Eight is a much more mature film. Tarantino has had 23 years to perfect his craft and it shows. Although I liked Django Unchained, it isn’t as good as The Hateful Eight. The Hateful Eight may be one of the better films I’ve seen in the past few years. Note 1: Mark Z. Danielewski’s House of Leaves is a piece of art as much as a novel. But, there isn’t a digital version. This is deliberate. Danielewski can’t determine a way for readers to digitally consume the book. Contrary to what you expect, this control is more easily achieved with print than film. Note 2: Like all Quentin Tarantino’s movies, The Hateful Eight isn’t for children. Quentin Tarantino is great because of his dedication to his art. Tarantino made a purposeful choice to not have a relationship or children because it would affect his art. I wonder if his decision is partially due to discussions around the dinner table about what Daddy does without showing them. I don’t know if Tarantino has actually thought about the ramifications of raising a child in the dark to his art until a certain age. Maybe he hasn’t. But, If I was in his shoes, I would have internal conflict about not wanting to twist my kid’s minds until they were of age to deal with my creations.

This one started off quite like a normal western, so I thought it wouldn't be like the director's previous film 'Django Unchained'. In fact, it was considered for a sequel to that, but the director felt this story and the previous character Django failed to blend, hence 'The Hateful Eight' was born with Samuel L. Jackson playing an important role. Solid eight from me for this QT's eighth film. But I felt the movie was kind of inspired by 'And Then There Were None'. It was not about to find who's the killer or next to be killed. The character introductions were at its best and an excellent twist in the middle. This sets in a cabin with eight strangers struck there after the snowstorm. But after an unexpected event the suspicious started to mount and brings chaos. Then takes us to the flashback to reveal something the story that did not mention in the earlier part which's very essential for coming back to the finale. The 80% of the movie was just talking, but the remaining stunt sequences were so powerful. All the eight, plus, supporting character were exceptional, but the director's favourite Samuel L. Jackson nailed it as his character is a bit above from the rest. The entire film was shot is a couple of locations, but the major portion takes place in a cabin and it was a limited cast movie.

IMHO, the best performance is from Walton Goggins, though. A usual secondary which has the chance in this movie to be more than just that.

There's a constant sense of mistrust in the air, while racism, misogyny and political fall outs pulse away in set up scenarios. Then it's the second half, where after a wee bit of narration that had me thinking my Blu-ray player had somehow started playing The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, hell then comes to Minnie's! It quickly becomes evident we have been part of a Tarrantino parlour game, a game of Clue - cum - Ten Little Indians, only in a Wild West setting, and with blood, bones and bile in full effect. The whole thing is wonderfully stylish in the way that Tarrantino is known for. The cartoonish horror mingles with more biting observations on humanity, the violence shocks to get a reaction from the viewer, for better or worse, and always there is humour, where Hateful Eight proves itself to be one damn funny film. Morricone scores it as cartoon horror with Western strains, and it's magnificent, it sounds like the evil twin to his score for The Untouchables.

Along with a black bounty hunter (Samuel L. Jackson) and the new Sheriff of Red Rock (Walton Goggins), they hold up at a rural haberdashery during a blizzard with several dubious characters (Tim Roth, Demián Bichir, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern and Channing Tatum). Dana Gourrier and Zoe Bell appear in small roles. This was Tarantino’s second Western in a row after 2012’s “Django Unchained,” which ranks with the best Westerns of all time. This one’s not as good, but it certainly has its points of interest, like the great wintery wilderness atmosphere, which is to die for. Moreover, the plot is intriguing. It\'s basically an Agatha Christie whodunit a la Murder on the Orient Express transferred to the Old West. Roughly 90% of the film takes place in the haberdashery and, less so, a stagecoach. It\'s basically a theater play masquerading as a movie and I found it a unique setting for a Western. The movie starts out with spectacular Colorado winter cinematography highlighted by an excellent Ennio Morricone score, his first full-length score in over three decades (!). Compelling extended dialogues have always been Tarantino’s strong suit; and so it is here. The amusing melodramatics are entertaining and the story keeps your interest despite the one-dimensional setting. Everything’s SO exaggerated that you can’t take it seriously. The movie’s intentionally offensive and you have to roll WITH the excesses to be entertained; otherwise you’ll hate it. On at least one occasion the overindulgences don’t work, like the disgusting fellatio sequence. I get that Marquis (Jackson) was lying to the other guy to compel him to draw, but we didn\'t need a visual on his fabricated story. It\'s sordid excess that has no place in a Western or any other movie, except gay porn, but Tarantino obviously included it in order to be ""edgy"" or whatever. The excellent opening with the figure of Christ dying for our sins keys off the theme, which is humanity’s fallen condition and dire need of redemption. The title, “The Hateful Eight,” is a perversion of “The Magnificent Seven.” The latter celebrates the noble and heroic whereas this movie parodies the base and odious. Tarantino is poking fun at our petty hostilities that separate us based on race, gender, sectionalism, faction-ism, envy and rivalry.

The characters are all stereotypes on a comedic level, but when the writing is this good, they become much more than that. Each character had some level of depth and uniqueness that gave this somewhat dry and slow plot a spark that continually kept the flame of the story burning. Samuel L. Jackson is brilliant, this movie was directly written for him, and he makes use of every second of screen time he is given. His comedic delivery is excellent and towards the end of the movie his slyness and witty detective work are mesmerizing. Kurt Russell is hilariously stupid and his relationship with his captee (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is hilarious, sweet, and sometimes demented.

Tim Roth was awesome, and all the other gang members were great too. The only one that kind of stuck out was Channing Tatum.

All of the above are common knowledge but it doesn\'t hurt to remember these facts when viewing the award wining triumph of a movie that stands the test of time today. The film is so simple in structure it really needed something special to pull it out of the prospective banality of being ""just another road movie about finding oneself"", Rain Man achieves something special by tackling its subjects with very sensitive hands and splicing a believable human concept into the story via the incredible shows from its two leading men. Dustin Hoffman gives a magical moving performance as the Autistic Savant Raymond, the ultimate complement I can pay the performance is that it really is believable, both moving and clever rolled into one artistic result. Tom Cruise is equally as great in a role that called for drastic layer changes, a role that demanded much conviction from the actor taking it on, and Cruise gives the role much depth as he goes from shallow bastard to a very emotive and feeling human being, it\'s a great show that stands up to reevaluation these days. A performance that seems to have sadly been forgotten in light of Hoffman\'s film stealing show. With a film such as this you pray that the ending can do it justice, and I\'m glad to say that there is no pandering here, it\'s an ending that says so much because it doesn\'t cop out, I thank god for those rewrites because the endings to the original scripts would have had me booting the TV set out of the window.

No, she is not just like him. In addition to her autistic, obsessive behavior, she is deaf and developmentally delayed so that even though she knows sign language, she only answers questions with it and never uses complete sentences.

For example, when she lived t home with us as a child, if we grabbed the TV guide from next to the tv to check out the schedule, she would stand over us and get more and more agitated and shake with frustration and anger. We finally had to start buying two TV guides, one that was ""hers"" and one that was ""ours."" But we couldn\'t buy two of everything.

The meeting offers her far more than a glimmer, she need only complete three tasks and will find herself taking up her inheritance as a princess and reunited with her kingly father. What now ensues is a fairy tale full of dark magic and untrustworthy characters whom the young girl must face if she is to succeed. Given the atrocities being carried out in the real world around her, she seeks more and more solace in this nether world that is probably just as dangerous - it certainly has it\'s fair share of malevolence and duplicity - but with her father the ultimate goal, she perseveres with wisdom and gritty determination. What makes this work is the delicious permutations of evil it offers. Contrasting the real with the fabled, the human with the fantasy - and the decency the young girl epitomises is by no means certain of success. The visual effects cleverly integrate both of her worlds without dominating the look of the film or the potency of the story - one of love, ambition, fear, trickery.

Dario Argento’s Deep Red (AKA: Profundo Rosso/The Hatchet Murders) is rightly regarded as one of the leading lights of Giallo. Argento pitches Marcus Day (David Hemmings working from a splinter of Blow Up) into a rousing and visceral world of murder and mystery – and takes the viewers along as well! It doesn’t matter what time of day or night it is, Argento always has a sinister edge pulsing through his movie.

A time when ones purpose was established in taking pride in what you do, no matter how insignificant it is perceived within society. A movie about life. What I enjoyed about this movie is how it brings the viewer into a first person perspective of the life journey of an ordinary person. This movie is as close to a first person encounter with Japanese day to day life, as you can obtain without actually living there.  It does an excellent job of introducing a few unusual and odd personalities someone living in Japan will encounter. The majority of this movie could be watched without subtitles or audio, because it masterfully achieves the filmmaker goal of ""show the story, instead of telling the story"". Having lived in Japan as a teacher, this movie was like watching my own experience seen from the lense of a camera.  It really represents life in Japan in true form. Things I Didn\'t Enjoy This is a very slow moving movie at three hours long.  it could of been shorter and still achieved its goal. I\'m not a fan of the transitional collages used to represent dreaming or the transition from night to day.  These became redundant and felt like a waste of time.

This character study about the life of a middle-aged public toilet cleaner in Tokyo (Koji Yakusho) follows him through his virtually unchanging daily routine of working, reading and taking nearly identical photos of trees. Even though there are minor differences in the events of his day-to-day life, much of his schedule is relentlessly the same, a comfortable yet mundane pattern that\'s cinematically repeated endlessly (and one can imagine what that does for holding viewer interest). He seems to purposely keep his life simple to avoid irritating complications, but that appears to be more of a way to stave off loneliness than to provide reassuring measures of certainty and predictability. He also appears to have undergone a painful (though largely unexamined) past that he\'s trying to escape, even though he clings to many elements that are rooted in that historical time frame (he listens to cassette tapes from the 1970s-80s, takes photos with a film camera, uses a flip phone and has little awareness about the internet). This lifestyle is presented as the source of some kind of supposedly profound wisdom, yet the insights that emerge from it are, quite frankly, innately simplistic (""the next time is the next time"" and ""now is now"" - truly deep principles, to be sure). As a consequence, all of this makes for a rather tedious watch, one filled with story threads that go largely unexplored and, ultimately, unresolved. To its credit, the film features some fine cinematography and an excellent soundtrack, and it grows progressively more engaging the further one gets into the story (when a story actually begins to develop out of a largely flatlined narrative). But, despite these assets, much of the picture\'s opening half is riddled with extraneous material that could have readily been pruned. In fact, the removal of that superfluous content could have easily reduced this work down to a more manageable extended short without losing anything, a change that would have yielded a more worthwhile viewing option. I\'m a longtime fan of Wenders\' work, but this offering just doesn\'t measure up to his past releases. It\'s also somewhat baffling how this production has garnered as much attention as it has, such as its selection as Japan\'s entry in the 2023 Academy Awards\' international film category, for which it garnered an Oscar nomination (amazingly beating out the far superior Japanese film ""Monster"" (""Kaibutsu"")), as well as Yakusho\'s best actor award at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.

A week ago I saw a zombie film from Japan called \'I Am a Hero\' and now this Korean. I have not seen a quality zombie film at the recent time. The second tier films like \'Cooties\', \'Freaks of Nature\', \'Scouts Guide...\', all these were comedies. Probably \'World War Z\' was the last decent zombie film I have seen and after that this is the one. So the timing of the film was another advantage. Since there\'s no competition, this zombie film rules. And not to forget the Korean style, they are among the best thriller film makers today. Directed by an Anime filmmaker, this is his first live-action film. When I decided to watch it, I thought it would be another Korean film, which rely on father-daughter sentiments. You know I kind of tired of that Korean cliché where at the final stage they let the kid sob and call it a twist. Initially I enjoyed those and later on getting bored of that. With that kind of reasons, I would have missed it. Being a film fanatic, I won\'t mind to risk a watch, except give up writing a review for it. But in this case, it was completely different. Even the characters, any characters in the film, either in the lead or the supporting ones, all are unpredictable. That\'s the biggest plus point of the film. At the end you won\'t be sure, who you were rooting for. You know in those edgy scenes, we blindly back the one we like. You will think you can guess the upcoming scenes, but the writing was very smartly done. Feels like they did not care about a sequel, if this meets a greater success. But who knows, this is a cinema and there were many mysteries kept unsolved, so they can pick up from one of those loops. ""Whatever you do, you must finish what you start. It\'s worse than not doing it at all."" This is the story of a divorced, workaholic father and his young daughter. After the progress, many others join them. On her birthday, they decide to visit her mother in Busan. On their train, soon after it took off, they come to know that something is wrong around. With all the chaos unrolling rapidly, a group of survivours gathers in a car since there\'s no escape as they are trapped in a moving train. How their journey ends, whether they reach a safe place with the fight against the living dead, the narration comes to halt. In the contest of good versus evil, there\'s no place for sentiments. But at one stage, near the end they cleared the place to attach one. In that final scene you can\'t resist, even if you are not an emotional person when it comes to the film. As I mentioned earlier that is the part I feared the most would come, but i did not hate it in the context of story development. Because that was a perfect setting to take the story to the next level. There are several twists. Those are from the film characters\' perspective than the story wise. They did not bother to tell about the cause of the epidemic. Instead, this film was focused on the train passengers and their fight for survival when the defending options are limited. Just imagine it is a zombie version of another Korean film \'Snowpiercer\' or like \'Snakes on a Plane\'. I have heard there\'s another film, an animation which is also directed by the same filmmaker and said to be a prequel to this one. If you had liked it, you would be itching to watch that one as well. Hope I would watch it as soon as I get an opportunity. So, my view on it, the film is very good. It was close to two hours long, but once the train journey begins, you won\'t going to notice the time. I am saying the pace of the film, as well as the events make you dissolve in it completely and forget everything else.

A zombie outbreak that leaks onto a train (with just one infected), and these are ""World War Z"" running, 15 seconds to turn (usually) zombies.  I\'m staunchly against running zombies, but when you do something well, it is really hard to discredit you for it. There is one aspect that is truly odd for zombies, but it would be quite the spoiler, it\'s basically the 3rd act (out of 4).  The writing structure feels very different, it doesn\'t seem to adhere to a 3 act staple: it really feels like 4 acts broken into chapters (or levels similar to a video game) and as whichever characters survive the transfer from chapter to chapter, the story progresses.  There is clearly though pre-infection establishing act, post infection establishing act, confrontation act, and resolution act.  Once you get past the first act, it\'s pretty much non-stop action, by the by. The one frustrating part about this movie is that most of the characters seem to have a death wish: despite trying to stay alive, they all seem to want to die.  I understand that a story can\'t happen without flawed characters, but the things these people do are so remarkably stupid sometimes that the zombies become more believable at times.

The Walking Dead franchise is arguably the most popular show on Earth when it comes to portraying this supernatural future. World War Z and the Zombieland duology play that role in the movies\' realm. However, all of these works fail to reach the always high expectations that come with a story set in a time like this. When people ask, ""what\'s the best zombie apocalypse film ever?"", one doesn\'t have a clear answer simply because there isn\'t an outstanding, mind-blowing, near-perfect flick. Well, at least not until 2016, the year of release of the best movie in the genre, Train to Busan. I genuinely feel sorry for everyone who refuses to watch foreign films for whatever reason. A different language and/or the display of subtitles shouldn\'t be enough to convince viewers to ignore so many unique works from all around the world. If someone dares to call themselves a ""zombies fan"" and has not watched Train to Busan yet, then ""fan"" is far from being the right description. This is South Korean cinema at its best. Everyone is 200% committed to their role, whether that is a stunt man or one of the protagonists. Yeon Sang-ho delivers a powerfully suspenseful, intense, epic, and most of all, heartbreaking story with the help of a phenomenal screenplay written by Park Joo-suk. When the only ""negative"" aspect that I can find is related to ""maybe not-that-logical"" specific actions performed by some characters, I know that I\'m nitpicking a near-perfect movie. I struggle to find a single real issue with the entire film. In my opinion, the reason why the latter works so well is largely due to Park Joo-suk\'s script. Usually, people always think about the zombies first: how do they look? How do they act? Do they run wildly or stroll? Which new attributes or skills do these zombies have different from what we\'ve seen until now? How did it all begin? Is there a cure? Granted, the zombies look cool, and Yeon Sang-ho is able to create impressive action sequences filled with maximum intensity and extreme tension. Entertainment-wise: top-notch. However, the action only works as well as it does due to the emotional bond that the viewer shares with the (non-infected) human characters. These are beautifully treated and developed in such a remarkable manner. There are easily five to six characters that the viewer ends up caring deeply about. Typically, at least half of this group is expendable in this type of film because some characters show no signs of intelligence or are just douchebags. In Train to Busan, every single character possesses likable traits, besides being directly connected to each other (father-daughter, young couple pregnant). The action scenes are filmed in incredible fashion, but it\'s the encompassing emotional aura that ultimately elevates them. It\'s really an emotionally devastating story. The viewer is placed in dozens of situations that require the hardest of choices from the main characters. The generic dilemma ""do I save the person I care about or everyone else?"" is taken to a whole other level with exceptional dialogues, filled with an excruciating amount of suspense, leaving me about to tear up on more than just a couple of times. Every character has a terrific, compelling arc. The main protagonist, Seok-woo (Gong Yoo), goes from being a despicable character, one that I wouldn\'t mind seeing killed in the first fifteen to twenty minutes, to a lovable father that only wants what\'s best for her daughter, protecting her at all costs during the apocalypse. This movie is packed with clever social commentary, relatable to this day (and even more during the current global pandemic). Yon-suk (Kim Eui-sung) represents everything that\'s wrong with our society. A selfish man who thinks he\'s more important than everyone else due to his class and whose job is more significant than his own family or friends, let alone strangers on a train. He also works as a ""wake-up call"" to our protagonist, as a ""what if"" version of Seok-woo\'s future if he continues to only focus on his job. Another character of great relevance is Sang-hwa (Ma Dong-seok), a father-to-be who ends up protecting Seok-woo\'s daughter when her father can\'t. His bravery and selflessness make him an instant audience favorite. Technically, it\'s genuinely a flawless film. From the outstanding zombie makeup to the mind-blowing stunt work, everything action-related serves as evidence to prove that South Korean cinema does action a thousand times better than conventional Hollywood. The level of intensity is ridiculous. Lee Hyung-deok\'s camera work is absolutely brilliant, moving through the train seamlessly, letting the viewer see and understand everything. Aided by excellent editing (Yang Jin-mo) and a phenomenal score (Jang Young-gyu), Yeon Sang-ho generates tension and suspense in a way that makes every single action sequence feel overwhelming, powerful, and even epic. A runtime close to the two-hour mark that flies by. The first act perfectly sets up the apocalypse to come with a surprisingly subtle build-up of the exponentially growing chaos. Then, the outbreak in the train which occupies most of the movie\'s duration. During this period, everything happens. From the nail-biting action sequences to the emotionally powerful moments of character decisions that make this film so shocking. Finally, a third act that left me floored, completely drained of emotions, not knowing exactly how to feel after it all ended. Despite a couple of sequences that I believe were exclusively executed in the way they were to offer an emotionally climactic moment, everything else feels impressively realistic. All in all, Train to Busan is arguably the best zombie apocalypse movie of all-time, at least, until the date of this review. The subgenre finds in Yeon Sang-ho\'s mind-blowing flick the masterpiece it deserves. From the exceptionally subtle build-up to the emotionally devastating final act, passing through the most vivid, suspenseful, tense depiction of a zombie outbreak ever put to screen, Park Joo-suk\'s screenplay is the reason why this film succeeds so well. A heartbreaking story featuring astonishingly well-developed characters, surrounded by a powerfully resonant social commentary, even more in the current days. Action-wise, it\'s South Korean cinema at its best: maximum intensity, phenomenal camera work, seamless editing, chill-inducing score, outstanding commitment from everyone involved, and a fantastic stunt team. Hollywood should learn from movies like this. I can\'t find a single flaw. It left me emotionally drained. If you\'re a fan of cinema, no matter the genre, thismustbe on your watchlist!

Not feeling like sitting home tonight, I decided to catch this one, and luck was with me. My image of Indian movies, I confess, was that they were mostly musicals centering around a love story involving a very beautiful young woman and a very handsome young man, with lots of elaborate, high-energy dance numbers to keep things going. There is a love story here, but it\'s not the focus of the film. There are also a few large and very impressive dance numbers, but only a few. (The men\'s dancing, extremely athletic, astounded me.) Rather, this movie focuses on the story of two young men in 1920s India who, each in his own way, are fighting against the English occupiers. The English are portrayed as inhuman monsters. Very often, they made me think of the worst atrocities committed by the Germans in France during World War II, or the most rabid racists in the American South. The first time we see the two male leads dancing, a link is indeed made between the Indians and what appear to be Black American musicians. Every time the Indians manage to take revenge on the English for their inhuman abuse of the Indians, you cheer - but at times I wondered if I would have cheered watching a parallel movie about Blacks taking revenge on white racists who had mistreated them in the American South, especially if I had been in a movie theater where, like tonight, I was the only audience member who did not belong to the oppressed population. Imagine Spike Lee, for example, able to make a movie in which he did not have to worry about selling tickets to whites as well as Blacks, and you have some idea of how anti-British colonials this movie is. It is the difference between a society in which the oppressor was a small minority of the population vs. Here, where Blacks are a minority of the American population. I don\'t want to push this comparison too far. The movie only makes the connection in one scene. But this is very definitely a movie that focuses on the story of a brutally oppressed people seeking freedom from an inhuman oppressor, rather than just a series of dance numbers. I don\'t speak any of the Indian languages used in the movie, but I had no problem following what was going on with the subtitles, which were almost always easy to read. I\'m sure there were cultural references I didn\'t catch, however, especially at the end in the final big dance number, which seemed to be presenting India as a nation of different regions and cultures all united in one. The director and cinematographer definitely deserve praise. There was one very striking visual image after the next, especially during the battle scenes. Ram Charan, dressed as a ""native warrior""-if that term means anything anymore-flying through flames was breathtaking. So, if you\'ve even been curious about Indian movies, give this one a try. Yes, it\'s three hours long, but trust me, the time goes flying by.

It’s an over-the-top historical spectacle about a violent uprising in 1920s India, offering a fictitious retelling of real events. This international blockbuster has everything: thrilling action sequences, adrenaline-charged stunts, a rousing story, and euphoric Bollywood dance scenes that are nothing short of show-stopping. The plot centers around two real-life India revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan Teja) and Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.), and imagines what would have happened had the two met and become friends. In “RRR,” the men join together to fight against the British Raj and brutal colonialism in order to save the people. The trail of vengeance begins after a young girl is abducted and Bheem takes action to free her from the tyrannical regime. Raju is working for the enemy and becomes a strong adversary to Bheem’s rescue mission. Clashes and chaos ensue when the two start working together. This movie is crazy, ridiculous, silly, excessive, and absolutely amazing. Director S.S. Rajamouli has an enviable skill and master of the craft, as he puts together some truly inventive and unforgettable sequences. Everything is executed with precision and it all works, no matter how outrageous the ideas sound (like unleashing an army of CGI animals into an unsuspecting crowd). This is a strong achievement in directing, and it’s one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen. Part of the reason the film works so well is due to the two charismatic leads who can act, dance, sing, and do their own stunts. They’re bonafide action stars with old Hollywood charisma and charm, and their screen presence is unmatched. I could happily watch these two in anything. They’re so good together that audiences should be begging for a sequel. It’s not all lighthearted fun, and Rajamouli takes his historical setting seriously. The film doesn’t gloss over brutality and violence, and there are upsetting scenes of abuse and death. Men, women, and children are put in great peril. The heroes in the movie are mostly men, and women are the ones who need to be rescued. This is a macho story and not a feminist one, but that doesn’t make much of a difference to the classic action movie vibe. Everything is dialed up to the maximum level, and every second of the movie’s 3-hour-plus run time is packed. “RRR” is a crowd-pleasing cinematic experience that’s intoxicating, exhilarating, and delivers a ton of fun.

The CGI, of course, is fantastic. What I love about this movie, though, is that it\'s not just an empty, trivial story as an excuse for CGI. Quite the contrary. The story itself is a fictionalized version of a very real, revolutionary period just before Gandhi\'s non-violence movement took the lead. If anyone could make any complaint at all, it would be that the British roles are caricatures. Honestly though, what do we white Americans know of how Imperial Britain treated its ""non-white subjects""? We DO know that, in 1919, British troops fired on a crowd of unarmed protesters killing hundreds of men, women and children. So the film is steeped in real history. Perhaps, the caricatures were Rajamouli\'s way of side-stepping the issue by allowing the viewer to accept them at the same level of unreality as the two super heroes of the film. The film itself is over the top, fun and action-packed. It even has the requisite Bollywood dance scenes! I loved the way Ram became Rama, the mythological Hindu archer, an avatar of Vishnu.

As a Disney fan since my childhood, I'm very happy for their success in live-shot films and animations, especially for this one. Okay, since the revolution of 3D animation over 20 years ago after overthrowing the 2D animation, most of the big productions like Disney, Pixer and Dreamworks with few others never failed to deliver.

The plot is simple yet clever, unfolding naturally without unnecessary complexity. It keeps things engaging with steady character development, making you feel connected to the leads as their situation evolves. While some critics seem to take the romance out of context, it actually makes perfect sense within the story. It’s not just there for the sake of it but develops realistically based on their circumstances. Sure, there are some plot holes, but unless you're watching just to nitpick, they don’t take away from the experience. Visually, the movie stands out with dramatic lighting and smart camera work that keeps you immersed. Even daytime scenes carry a certain mood that adds to the film’s atmosphere. The cinematography is well thought out, with the right angles capturing the emotional depth of the characters while also making the action sequences hit hard. Speaking of action, while there’s plenty of it, the movie does lean more into its emotional core rather than being a full-on action spectacle. The CGI is solid, blending in naturally without feeling overdone, and while some moments might remind you of other films, it never feels like a cheap copy. The performances are strong, with both leads carrying the entire movie effortlessly. Their chemistry feels real, and their dialogue doesn’t come off as forced or unnatural. The script is well executed, moving the story forward at the right pace without dragging things out. The music and sound design complement the film nicely, enhancing key moments without overpowering them. Overall, The Gorge has a high rewatch factor, the kind of movie you'd want to show a friend just to experience it again.

Oddly, I would argue its the creative cocktail of discordant genres and elements, that actually helps this film succeed. Firstly, ""The Gorge"" works wonderfully as a romance. The chemistry between the key characters sparkles with humour, quirkiness and passion. It functions too, as a fantasy horror, sci fi, thriller with highly creative story and action aspects, that come together beautifully.

Janet Leigh is on hand as the detective’s new bride, an American. “Touch of Evil” (1958) was written/directed by Welles (loosely based on a book) and has a huge reputation as a B&W noir-ish cult flick. There ARE interesting technical things going on as far as camera angles, lighting and impressive long takes (e.g. the opening sequence). It also has a notable classic cast with Leigh thoroughly stunning, not to mention Joanna Moore, Marlene Dietrich, Joi Lansing and a cameo by Zsa Zsa Gabor on the female front. Yet I otherwise found the picture talky, nigh surreal and noticeably hokey with an unengrossing story and dubious acting, e.g. the hooligan Mexicans and the eye-rolling Shakespearean lunatic “night man” (Dennis Weaver). Seriously, viewing this film is like entering Welles’ head on an acid trip. That said, the film offers quite a bit to digest and I could see it playing better on additional viewings, which explains its cult status, but I’m not interested. There are far more fascinating and compelling B&W dramas with noteworthy casts from that general era, like “The Misfits” (1963). I viewed the long reconstructed version, aka the “director’s cut,” which runs about 110 minutes while the original studio-butchered version runs 93 minutes. Interestingly, the film wasn’t shot anywhere near the border, let alone the Texas border, but in freakin’ Venice, Los Angeles.

One crime and two totally different men: this sentence almost sums up the entire film. Director Orson Welles is one of those monsters that we are used to having like a “sacred cow”, who turns everything he touches into gold. And really, he is responsible for great films and was an excellent artist, who understood cinema like few others did. However, in this film, his work was absolutely trampled on by stupid studio managers, and the result of this is that it was only very recently that it was possible to have access to a version of this film that was similar to what its director's creative vision was. . Just similar! And what we have here is an incredibly complex film that we cannot summarize as easily as I did: the initial crime is just the incident that triggers the action, and its relevance, we found, is really insignificant. What counts here is the struggle of personalities, the battle between the conflicting egos of two police officers who decide to solve the case, each in their own way. In fact, it is not the most appealing film that the director's career has given us, but it is still valuable for that reason. And to understand Welles' vision, it's not enough to see the film once. We have to understand nuances that go unnoticed by an inattentive eye. It's an exercise for cinema experts, more than for me, who am part of the common popcorn-eating public, but even I saw that the work before me deserved to be seen in detail. The film that has come down to us allows us to see the brilliance of Welles, who was also responsible for the dialogues and the script created, full of twists and turns that can complicate things a little for us if we are not paying attention, and, but it also gives us good actors in a decent dramatic exercise. Charlton Heston is a safe bet, but it's also a big casting mistake: he's too Anglo-Saxon to be credible as a Latino! Welles brought the other main character to life, and is effective and dominant in the role. To a certain extent, he never seems like a police officer, but just another criminal in a land where those in charge are those who impose themselves through violence. Even so, I noticed that he is a physically worn-out man, and this fragility ruins the effect he intends to achieve. Technically, the film has many qualities, starting with the cinematography, which in Welles' films is almost always one of the director's signatures. In addition to the use of intelligent visual effects, the director dedicated himself to the camera work and the choice of each perspective, each framing, and also in the editing, which was ruined by the studio's intervention. The filming locations and sets are realistic and convince us quite well, and the soundtrack is effective."", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}]",100,Yes!
