Based on the wonderful writing from Jules Verne, Around the World in Eighty Days is just shy of three hours, this was my first ever visit to the film and my reaction is mainly positive, though tempered with a small sense of unfulfillment. Phileas Fogg takes a wager from his fellow London club members that he can\\'t circle the globe in 80 days, this it should be noted is 1872 where transport was not of the fast and dynamic variety. Fogg and his trusty servant Passepartout, set off on a journey that brings many adventures, and many humorous scrapes. They meet a wonderful array of characters and travel on many forms of transport, it is in short a magical journey. The production here from Mike Todd is gargantuan, the sets are incredible, the multiple locations befit the multi cast of actors that grace the film (have fun playing spot the star in this one). The costumes and the score are spot on, while Lionel Lindon\\'s cinematography rightly won the gold award because it\\'s lush and cloaks the delightful story with a number of treats for the eyes. David Niven is perfect as Fogg, whilst Cantinflas as Passepartout is perfect foil for Fogg\\'s staid stiff upper lippery. Yet in spite of it\\'s obvious beauty the film is a touch overlong, some scenes are padded far too much when surely a shorter take would have made its mark equally enough? I was surprised by the ending being so short and sweet, yes, sure it\\'s fitting, but after sitting through just under 3 hours of film you are not being unreasonable to expect a grand fanfare type of ending. Still, it doesn\\'t take away from this being a good cinematic achievement. As to if it stands up to repeat viewing?

An unsurpassable cast delivering a story depicting the ultimate in compendium storytelling. What could go wrong? Well, sadly - quite a lot. David Niven is fine as the dapper sophisticate \"Fogg\" who along with his gentleman\\\\\\'s gentleman of one whole day \"Passepartout\" (the acrobatic Cantinflas) accepts a bet from some toffs in the Reform Club that he cannot circumnavigate the world in 80 days. Steam trains, balloons, ships, camels, horses, even a paddle-steamer facilitate their travels with just about every movie star on the books joining in as our tour of the world offers us colourful and entertaining escapades from many different countries and cultures. There is a sort of chemistry between the two travellers, but they are all to often apart on screen, and sadly I thought, it is the very diversity of the stories that lets this down. It is too episodic: the narrative frequently lacks cohesion, often little better than a colourful, occasionally pithy, travelogue and even the mischievous contributions from a super Robert Newton (\"Insp. Fix\") who reckons \"Fogg\" is really an infamous bank robber, and the delightful antics of Shirley MacLaine as the \"Princess Aouda\" can\\\\\\'t really redeem or sustain it. It is long, but that needn\\\\\\'t have been a problem (at least it isn\\\\\\'t 80 days) it\\\\\\'s just flat, somehow - so much more could have been going on, but wasn\\\\\\'t. To be fair, it does hot up in the last twenty minutes or so, as their quest comes to a head but that isn\\\\\\'t enough. The technical aspects are flawless, however - particularly the photography; with the costumiers facing a sartorial Herculean task and Victor Young\\\\\\'s score is suitably international in it\\\\\\'s themes and well worthy of his Oscar.

Where do I begin? I just got back from the cinema and I can still feel the adrenaline rushing through me. I was already a huge fan of director Neill Blomkamp's previous effort, District 9, so my expectations were running pretty high. And for once, I was not disappointed. No, I got even more than I could have hoped for. Elysium is a terrific film. Plain and simple. The story is fairly simple, which I consider a good thing because the plot was easy to follow and so it wasn't overly complex and trying to be too intelligent and contrived. It is the year 2154, and planet Earth is one hot mess. The rich reside on a space station called Elysium while the poor remain on Earth, basically grabbing at every straw just to get by. The story we follow is that of Max, who, after a terrible accident at work, is in dire need of medical help, which is only available at Elysium. In order to get there, he must go to extreme measures. I won't tell you anything else, because that would just spoil the fun. Max is played by Matt Damon, and he is very good in this role. He truly carries the film, start to finish. It always pleases me to see an actor who is just as good at tackling the character elements as well as the action parts of his role. When you think about it, that doesn't actually happen that often. Matt Damon can do both perfectly, and he is convincing in every aspect. Jodie Foster plays the role of senator Delacourt, a rich bitch who thinks she can get away with anything just because she calls the shots on Elysium. Well, somebody's about to prove her wrong... I absolutely love Jodie Foster, so it's hard not to gush, but she is a delight to watch. Her character is cold, calculating and without a sliver of conscience. And Jodie is so convincing you just want to slap her. It was great, and the fact that her accent is a little weird and distracting at times, is easily forgiven. William Fichtner also appears in a relatively small, but crucial role. The biggest surprise for me, however, was Sharlto Copley. Remember him from District 9? He played Wikus, a dorky and kind of sissy character... Well, not in this one. His character Kruger, is the meanest, most vile bastard you can imagine. A card-carrying sadistic psycho. It really was a great opportunity for Copley to prove his versatility as an actor, and he used it to the fullest. Also, somehow his South-African twang made his character even more menacing, so I'm really glad he didn't drop it in favour of a – perhaps more crowd-pleasing – American accent. My biggest compliment goes to the special effects department. As was the case with District 9, the SFX are so convincing, it's actually hard to realise that you're watching something that was probably 96% computer animated. Unlike D9, the visuals were even better here, if you can believe that. Usually, when a director's first film is a success and they up his budget for the next one, they go completely overboard and essentially ruin the aesthetics that made the first film so successfulcoughMatrixcough. In this case, all and everything was a major improvement. The action scenes are incredibly solid, the spacecrafts were eye-poppingly gorgeous (without being all flashy and futuristic – adding to the reality factor) and Elysium was a true sight to behold. 109 minutes of pure eye candy. There were only two things that slightly bothered me. One, the somewhat stereotypical characterization of the Rich vs. The Poor. Simply put, rich = evil and poor = good, no exceptions. Especially with the rich Elysium folk I found it a little bothersome that there wasn't a single person who seemed to have a heart, they were almost mechanical and so the polarisation was pretty black-and-white. Two, the lack of emotional involvement. I didn't really feel much for any of the characters, except Max. There is a plot line with a woman he has feelings for, whose daughter is very ill, and that's a sad thing but the film failed at really convincing me why I'm supposed to care. Could be personal, but that's the way I experienced it. However, these two minor plot points are not sufficient enough to deter me from giving this film any less than 10 stars. What I think is most thrilling about Elysium is the fact that it actually paints a frighteningly plausible picture of what our future might just look like. It is, in any case, much more realistic than pretty much every other post-apocalyptic film I've ever seen. Don't write this concept off too easily, this might very well be the world we live in one day. In the end, Elysium is a terrifically made film. It's gritty, it's gnarly and highly realistic. And, to the zero-attention-span MTV kids out there, it's also an incredibly entertaining, action-packed thrill ride. Tiny side note: the violence is quite graphic at times, so some amount of parental guidance is definitely advised. That leaves me with nothing else to say but: go watch this film.

This was Moore’s dynamic debut as Bond. He did 7 films for the franchise in 13 years from 1973-1985. The tone of “Live and Let Die” is similar to Sean Connery’s final canon Bond flick, “Diamonds Are Forever” (1971). Moore’s stint is my favorite run in the series with all seven films being kinetic, amusing, scenic and just all-around entertaining. There’s not one stinker in the bunch and they were all profitable at the box office. Aside from the picturesque globetrotting, “Live and Let Die” features several colorful characters beyond those already noted: The metal-armed Tee Hee (Julius Harris), the chortling voodoo minion Baron Samedi (Geoffrey Holder) and redneck Sheriff JW Pepper (Clifton James). On the female front, Seymour is young & cute while Gloria Hendry is impressively fit as Rosie. The head-turning Madeline Smith has a small role. In addition, there are several memorable thrilling parts, like the amusing airport sequence, Bond using crocogators as stepping stones, the great bayou boat chase and the closing train cab brouhaha. As far as the movie being “racist,” as SJW’s whine, the character Agent Quarrel Jr. (Roy Stewart) blows that whole eye-rolling idiot-theory. The film runs 2 hours, 1 minute and was shot in Manhattan, Jamaica and Louisiana (New Orleans & the bayous) with additional work done in England.

Team Connery all the way... but Live and Let Die is still a GREAT 007 film despite the total change in mood and persona. It moved away from the heartless assassin to pick up a more comedic and Fx driven fair that worked better for Moore. And because it is a new 007, the fish out of water setting works to drive it home. It's not the first time 007 set foot in the United States, but it is Harlem in 1973 and it is The Big Easy, and these are places that a white British man with an Oxford education would be a HORRIBLE person to act as a spy in. He's going to stick out like a sore thumb, and he does... ... and that is probably why they choose it as a setting to usher in Moore's era Bond. Because Moore was going to be different. He was the fish out of water in the franchise, and the setting helps drive it home. But, who cares, it was silly Bond, but it was FUN Bond. It was just fun in a different way than Connery was. But it was still fun, and fun is still entertaining.\", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 40), ('Comedy', 29), ('Thriller', 27), ('Action', 25), ('Other', 145)]}, {'writer': 'drystyx', 'score': '70%', 'review': 'This 007 film aged very well.\\n007 follows in the footsteps of three prior agents who were assassinated.\\nThere\\'s a lot of \"jive\" in this one, since this is the one where the villain is black, and he uses mostly black helpers, so the white James Bond really sticks out.\\nAnd thus we get a lot more comedy here.\\nThere\\'s a bit of a condescending attitude towards Harlem here, and too much respect for the few who are the criminals of Harlem, but this is a \"comedy\" 007 adventure.\\nThe beautiful Solitaire is the love interest, and there\\'s a lot of belief in the supernatural here.

This time, following the deaths of three other agents, \"Bond\" finds himself investigating a dodgy Caribbean ruler \"Katanga\" (Yaphet Kotto) who is using the prophetic skills of his tarot reader \"Solitaire\" (a rather beautiful but simpering, charmless, Jane Seymour) and a great deal of heroin to dominate the global narcotics market.

Obviously, the immediate point of gravity for this film is Ridley Scotts 1979 film \"Alien\". Let me start by saying the resemblance is only superifcal. This is very much its own film. Unlike \"Alien\" that ramps up the pace as the terror increases, The Sputnik is a slow burn sci fi. Yes, its an alien monster mash up but utlimately its as much psychological, as it is literal.

In this film, a group of three young people who live together (a couple and a single friend who lives in the house) discover that the old man who lives in the house in front of theirs, disappeared a few days ago and no one knows about him. When they investigated, they discovered a large camera in the middle of the room, and a collection of photos of their living room, taken by that mysterious machine that, to their surprise, takes pictures the day before they can happen. Reluctant to interfere in the future, they decided to imitate the photos, ensuring that nothing bad happened to them and fearing that the inventor had fallen, victim to any attempt to alter the future. But everything will get complicated when they start using the machine to earn extra money. The movie is quite good, and the story works on top of an intelligent and well-written script, which guarantees us an hour and a half of good cinema, although it is not completely free from predictability or cliché situations (such as the situation of love betrayal among the friends). For a film with low budget and high creativity, the result is quite positive. The reduced cast is expertly led by the trio Matt O'Leary, Danielle Panabaker and George Finn. The three actors seem to have a good rapport for the cameras, or that translates into a more harmonious and efficient work together. The film still has other actors, such as Amin Joseph or Jason Spisak, but only the three central actors that sustain the entire plot. On a technical level, the film is quite limited due to its setting, but what was done is very good, and care was taken in the technical execution of the film. The photography is quite good, and all the visual and special effects work was equally effective.\", 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 50), ('Comedy', 37), ('Thriller', 22), ('Crime', 21), ('Other', 123)]}]",

Inspector Amaia Salazar leads the investigation, taking her back to the heart of the Basque country where she was born, and where she hoped never to return. Shrouded in mist and surrounded by impenetrable forests, it is a place of unresolved conflicts and a terrible secret from Amaia’s childhood that will come back to haunt her.  Faced with the superstitions of the village, Amaia must fight the demons of her past to confront the reality of a serial killer on the loose.
