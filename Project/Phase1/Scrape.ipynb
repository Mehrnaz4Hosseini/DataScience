         "[{'writer': 'NeoBrowser', 'score': '100%', 'review': 'Peter Jackson has always maintained that The Two Towers is \"the second act\" of his epic undertaking, and perhaps the true greatness of the middle chapter will only be clear when viewed in context. As a stand-alone film, however, The Two Towers is not quite as good as Fellowship. (Nor, indeed, does it extend the universe or deepen the relationships in the manner of The Empire Strikes Back.) That it still merits the full five stars is merely an indication of how high the benchmark has been set. Picking up pretty much where Fellowship left off, this is a considerably darker film, with Frodo (Wood) falling further under the influence of the Ring (giving rise to some seriously spooky hallucinations), while Saruman (Christopher Lee) wreaks even more havoc. There\\'s also the first appearance of Saruman\\'s spy, the sinister Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and the complex Gollum, a brilliant combination of computer trickery and raspy vocals from Andy Serkis (the campaign for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar starts here). Other newcomers include Faramir (David Wenham), the understandably miffed brother of the recently deceased Boromir, and Éowyn (Miranda Otto), who spends much of her time casting winsome glances in the general direction of Aragorn (Mortensen). Eventually the plot complexities become more coherent, setting the action up for the forthcoming finale, The Return Of The King. As we\\'ve come to expect, this is spectacular stuff - from an opening which sees Frodo troubled by dreams about the demise of Gandalf, through to the climactic Battle Of Helm\\'s Deep, which is nothing short of breathtaking. But Jackson cleverly tempers the louder, brasher sequences with some heartstring-tugging moments - peasants despondent as they are forced to abandon their villages, Aragorn and Arwen\\'s troubled relationship, and, of course, the return of Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen, superb as ever), one of the film\\'s most powerful, memorable images that may well leave Ring devotees a little misty-eyed. However, those who still believe that the trilogy is beyond criticism may find their views challenged by The Two Towers. It\\'s just as long as the first film, but gets the heroes no closer to a final victory. And, where the first movie developed its emotional tone from the brightness of The Shire to a darker climax, the sequel is more of a one-note affair, shadowy in both look and content. This is particularly true of the Ringbearer\\'s quest, which adds the not-insignifcant Gollum to the party, but suffers more than the other story strands from the cross-cutting and finishes with a nearly identical pep talk from Sam to the tearful speech that climaxed Fellowship. Of course, given the nature of the material, and Jackson\\'s desire to be faithful, this is all understandable. And by the time we all end up under siege at Helm\\'s Deep, it\\'s unlikely anyone will give a toss about narrative arcs: like Gollum, this is simply gob-smacking, mind-blowing, never-seen-before stuff. Verdict - It may lack the first-view-thrill and natural dramatic shape of Fellowship, but this is both funnier and darker than the first film, and certainly more action-packed. An essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time. 5/5', 'most_watched_genres': [('Action', 14), ('Adventure', 13), ('Science Fiction', 9), ('Fantasy', 4), ('Other', 3)]}, {'writer': 'Wuchak', 'score': '60%', 'review': \"That Damned Ring. RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers” adapts the second part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The surviving ‘Fellowship’ of the first film has been divided into three small groups for this one: The Hobbits Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) team-up with the mad Gollum (Andy Serkis) to make their way to Mordor, but are captured by Faramir (David Wenham), the brother of the deceased Boromir. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) encounter the once-great King Theoden (Bernard Hill), who has fallen under the spell of Saruman (Christopher Lee) via his devious minion Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). Meanwhile the Hobbits Pippin and Merry (Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan) try to enlist the help of huge tree creatures. Gandalf is also on hand (Ian McKellen). These story threads culminate in the great Battle at Helms Deep in the third hour. This three-hour fantasy/adventure starts out more engaging than the first film, which was laden by its overlong, convoluted and (for the most part) unnecessary prologue. Like that movie, the characters are colorful, the tale is imaginative, there’s a lot of brutal action rounded out by quieter moments and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS great. Unfortunately, after the first act, Jackson opts for CGI porn (excessive use of CGI with the corresponding dizzying visual effects). The first film did this too, but this one ups the ante and so there’s not as much spectacular New Zealand cinematography (i.e. real forests, mountains, rivers, etc.). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you’ll likely appreciate this installment more than me. There are other problems: While the characters are imaginative, they’re also shallow and rather dull, at least for mature people who require more depth to maintain their interest. Also, the wide-spanning (meandering) story with numerous characters and hard-to-remember names tends to be disengaging. I was never much captivated by the characters and their causes, although uber-fans of Tolkien might be. Another problem is the lack of prominent female protagonists. We have Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden's niece, who falls in love with the noble Aragorn and that’s about it, except for cameos by Liv Tyler as Arwen and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. Despite these negatives, “The Two Towers” was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados who liked the first movie. THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 59 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.

Visually it still looks superb, I really do love the look of these films so far. The main plot is engaging and very interesting, while things like the costumes et al. remain at a high level. There is also top action, including some noteworthy battle sequences. There are, though, a few bits I found less great - still very good in the grand overall scheme, but just comparably with the 2001 release. I found the pacing to be slightly off in moments, while a few of the new cast members didn't connect to me - e.g. Bernard Hill. The side story, meanwhile, with Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan didn't interest me at all... they spend too much of the run time just walking through a forest. Elijah Wood remains good though. I did enjoy seeing the journey of Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin). Andy Serkis also gets more screen time with that aforementioned duo as Gollum, which is most definitely only a major positive - a fun character! Any scene with those three = outstanding. Overall, as noted, it is still an excellent film.

The CGI is less effective in this film; particularly when used against the close up and the \"Treebeard\" scenes where it is oddly static and sterile, but the siege and battle scenes at \"Helm\\'s Deep\", some poignant bonding moments between the elf and his dwarf companion and again the terrific accompaniment from Howard Shore make this, for my money, one of the best adventure films ever made.

         "[{'writer': 'trineo03', 'score': 'N/A', 'review': 'First of all, I love the animation style in this film. The animation in this film is styled to look like an actual comic book. I think this approach for this kind of film was an excellent choice because we’ve all seen the usual kind of animation but nothing like this. To tie in with the animation I need to talk about the action scenes in this film. These tie in with the animation because of the way the directors styled the action shots is to look like something in a comic panel. Most people don’t know who Miles Morales is and after this film, you’ll want to learn more about him because of how they made him so relatable in this film. He acts like a typical teen in this situation compared to other versions of Spider-Man. Other versions kind of just acted like they always knew how to use their powers when Miles struggles with his. Miles isn’t the only relatable character film all of them are. The creators of this film did a “Marvel”ous job at making each character in this film somebody at least one person in the audience can relate to. All of the voice actors did a great job in their respected roles but it would’ve been nice to have a returning voice to at least one of the Spider-Man. It would’ve been cool to hear a returning voice even if it was for a few seconds. I have to talk about the humour in this film. It isn’t overpowered in this film and I felt like it had just the right amount of humour that will make everybody laugh. They poke fun of things that wouldn’t make sense in a real movie and other Spider-Man movies. Not a single moment in this film felt rushed or slowed down every scene felt the right pace for a movie like this. The cinematography in this movie was spectacular. This is probably because of it looking like a comic book and how the lighting needs to match up with how it would look in an actual book. If you are a comic book junkie you’ll love all of the easter eggs in this film. Some of them just comic book readers will get but others a majority of people will understand.

It has animated style we have never seen before. There were 177 animators and it took 1 week to animate 1 second and 1 year to nail down 10 seconds. Nowadays, animations are being made to look real but this movie was different. However, the creators wanted it to look like something new for viewers. They don\\'t make it realistic or cartoon. The creators used an old-school technique called \"smear\". If you look in a single frame, you\\'ll notice things like multiple limbs to create the illusion of movement. Basically, the entire movie was a comic book that moves. There is a technique in half-toning, which uses dots to create colors and gradients. They were really jaw-dropping. The shadows were created with hatching or crisscrossed lines. The movie had some textures so it would be exactly like a comic and I was glad that it deserved Oscars\\'s Best Animated Feature. All of these techniques combined to make a movie that was the best animated feature not just in 2018 but perhaps of all time. It was really like a masterpiece of animation!\\n The story plot was really good. The scenes were quite EPIC and sometimes tragic and hilarious. The unbelievable thing was when Peter Parker died in Miles\\' Dimension. It was really sad to see an iconic superhero killed by a supervillain. The deaths are moving and the hilarious scenes kept me laugh a lot. I like the end-credits when it started in the Animated Tv Show Spider-Man (1966) when the two Spider-Men look exactly like each other arguing, but this time, it was Spider-Man pointing to Spider-Man 2099. How did they do that? Perhaps the best moment to me was “A Leap of Faith” when Miles tried to be the one and only Spider-Man in his dimension, after Peter Parker was dead.\\nI wasn\\'t bored watching this movie, it kept my eyes open on the screen looking at the newest kind of animation.

Lets tell it as it is, The Empire Strikes Back is a better film than Star Wars, not as impacting of course, but most definitely better. Technically, in story telling and in tone, it holds up well today and certainly warrants the amount of times it crops up in best sequels debates. That it's not actually a sequel is irrelevant, it is of course the filler in a wonderful sci-fi sandwich, because as second instalments go, Empire has few peers. With Empire Strikes Back we get all the whizz bang adventure strewn heart of Star Wars, but George Lucas (stepping aside for Irvin Kershner to direct) has also fleshed the story out with a serious dark tone that oddly becomes a bedfellow to the romantic fun on offer, where new and engaging characters (and creatures) add spice to this wonderful fantastical broth. Aided by the considerable writing talent of Leigh Brackett (The Long Goodbye, Rio Bravo, The Big Sleep), Lucas took the bold and ingenious step of giving the bad guys the upper hand, in fact it could be argued that he was taking a considerable risk with his ending. Forcing his viewers to wait for the final chapter (three years later), after tantalisingly setting us up with a corker of plot twist (one which is still to this day as potent as it was back on release), Lucas pulled perhaps one of the cheekiest carrot dangles in cinema history. Though more famed for its dark undertones, Empire is for sure still a very fun movie, C3PO goes into camp overdrive and Han Solo ups his quip quota by some margin. Then of course there is Yoda, in himself a comedic joy. The action sequences beg for repeat viewings, a battle on the ice laden planet Hoth is a marvel and the choreography for Skywalker's fight with Darth Vader is out of the top draw. But ultimately it's with the dark side that the picture excels.

And, we could use a lot more \"lived in\" Everything looks too clean. Empire had that. And then it had that big, legendary, reveal that made all those kisses between Luke and Leia utterly wrong once the second big reveal hit in 1983...which explained that look Han gave Leia when she told him in the next installment. Moving on... We have the Battle of Hoth, which, yeah, nerd awesomeness with kind of a WWI trench warfare v tanks feel and a WWII Evacuation of Dunkirk feel with the rebels on the run and the Empire forcing its way across the galaxy with brute strength. And that prolonged time on the Falcon, well, that was just brilliant for character development and, incest blocking. So, really, honestly, there was way too much to love not to put Empire on the throne.', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 40), ('Comedy', 29), ('Thriller', 27), ('Action', 25), ('Other', 145)]}, {'writer': 'CinemaSerf', 'score': '90%', 'review': 'I have reviewed this film before but I thought that it deserved an extra special mention. Yesterday, this was the first film I saw in a cinema since we were all confined to barracks - and boy what a cracker. Where to start with the superlatives? It\\'s fantastic - right from the opening bars of John Williams\\' score; on through the three mini-adventures rolled into one, we are treated to a marvellous feast of well-written, snappily directed, entertaining action packed adventure. Picking up from the first film, our rebels are holed up on a frozen planet being relentlessly pursued by Darth Vader. When one of his probes discovers their icebound base, they\\'ve got to get the hell out of there. Now sure, the CGI suffers a bit after 40 years; and can someone please tell me what the point of these lumbering Imperial Walkers is? They are like metal polar bears that constantly trip over their own shoelaces, but aside from those most minor of criticisms we have a great story; characters that we care about (personally, I\\'m an huge Vader fan) and who develop plausible, credible personalities; the detailed animations of \"Yoda\" are superb to see again on the big screen and it builds excellently to a sword fight the like of which has not been seen since \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938). It is, I think, better then the first film and for my money is the best sci-fi film ever made. Made for the big screen - and brilliantly made at that!', 'most_watched_genres': [('Drama', 48), ('Adventure', 29), ('Action', 21), ('Comedy', 18), ('Other', 113)]}]",

       "  'review': 'Some birds aren\\'t meant to be caged. The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them. There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn\\'t give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status. It\\'s possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that\\'s dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it\\'s the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red. Those in support aren\\'t faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there\\'s Roger Deakins\\' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman\\'s score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy\\'s state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart. If you love Shawshank then it\\'s a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10',\n",

       "  'review': 'Tim Robbins is wealthy banker \"Andy Dufresne\" who finds himself sentenced to life imprisonment after his wife and her lover are found murdered. The handsome \"new fish\" is initially the target of the \"sisters\" who would use him as they would like - but he fights back and gradually establishes a friendship with prison \"scrounger\" Morgan Freeman (\"Red\"). When he overhears the beastly prison guard captain bemoaning some tax problems, he, rather riskily, volunteers to help find a tax-free solution and is soon advising pretty much the whole place - including \"Warden Norton\" (Bob Gunton) on all things financial - some above board, some less so. The film is set over a period of over ten years, and depicts some of the most brutal aspects of prison life; but also some it\\'s more hopeful. It deals with violence and desperation but also of bonding and lasting friendships and loyalties that long term close-confinement engender. Frank Darabont elicits the best from his three principals superbly, with added venom provided by guard captain Clancy Brown and humanity from prison librarian James Whitmore - one of the few who actually does make parole. The last half hour is up there with the best cinema has ever had to offer, and this - again on a big screen - is a must see adaptation of one of Stephen King\\'s lesser known, but better, stories that delivers a redemption never, quite, anticipated by the prison service!',\n",

       "  'review': \"The Shawshank Redemption is one of those timeless classics that pulls you in with its heartfelt storytelling and remarkable performances. At its core, it’s a story about hope, friendship, and the resilience of the human spirit, set against the bleak backdrop of Shawshank prison. Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Red deliver deeply moving performances, capturing the bond that grows between two men confined by walls but freed by hope. Every scene feels purposeful, and the script, adapted from Stephen King’s novella, is simply brilliant in how it weaves small moments into a powerful narrative. One of the most unforgettable parts of the movie is Brooks’ storyline. Watching him leave the world he knew, only to find himself unable to adapt to a society that had progressed beyond his comprehension, is heartbreaking every time. It’s a stark reminder of how institutionalization can strip people of their ability to live freely, even after they've served their time. That moment, along with Red’s own journey, adds a bittersweet layer of realism to the story’s broader themes of freedom and redemption. The direction by Frank Darabont is masterful, turning what could have been a straightforward prison drama into something deeply profound. The setting of Shawshank feels both oppressive and oddly serene, perfectly capturing the tone of the story. The simplicity of the plot is its strength, allowing the characters and their emotional arcs to take center stage. With its pitch-perfect pacing, poetic dialogue, and an uplifting finale, The Shawshank Redemption remains a film that resonates on every rewatch. It’s not just a movie; it’s an experience.\",\n",
